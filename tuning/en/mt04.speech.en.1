human rights are fundamental principles and key values that we have been careful to incorporate in the constitutional reform presented to our people , so that the country 's constitution may mirror the eminence of the authorities of our political system and reflect our cultural project , the development of our society and its conscious involvement in the highest values produced by humanity .
these values , which we have incorporated and established in the constitution because there can be no return from them . we thus confirm our view , which is based on the mutual necessity of civil and political rights and of economic , social and cultural rights , of integration , and not selective preference , between them .
in them we reject discrimination in all its form and the politics of double standards with all its pretexts . just as we reject particularity as a cover by which to divest these universal values and principles , we reject that these same principles and values should be a means to abolish the cultural and civilization specificities of peoples .
the creation of the council of advisors represents an expansion in the representative forms of the people in the legislative authority and a confirmation of the principle of participation as a fundament of democratic practice . at the same time it keeps abreast with the development witnessed by the parties in all fields and interacts with the vitality of civil society throughout the years of change .
it is a development of the legislative authority and the forms of its representation . it supports the values of the republic , consolidates its institutions and grants a higher status to vital forces and national capacities therein .
this council will give a voice to the professional organizations by means of its waged , craftsmen and peasant members , organizations that are rich in potential and have a longstanding history of struggle .
for tunisia , the building of an information and communications society represents an essential national choice . we have confirmed it within a framework of a comprehensive rapprochement by means of continuing structural reforms and the support of the information and communications technology infrastructure of our country . it represents a cornerstone of the knowledge economy and a key factor in driving the mode of development .
our fundamental concern has been to develop human resources by drawing up an integrated plan to propagate the teaching of information at all levels of education and establish higher institutes for technology studies .
this is in addition to intensifying the formation of information and communications specialists , developing their abilities to understand modern technology and proficiently exploit it in the service of development , in addition to directing the nubs and expanses of technology to renewable projects in different parts of the country .
we have also focused our efforts on propagating digital culture across the widest scope by means of the regular programs in the different forms of the media ; by establishing information centers for children in all parts of the republic ; by linking educational institutions from all educational stages , primary , secondary and tertiary , to the internet ; not to mention propagating information and internet clubs in the cultural expanses and setting up a network of internet centers open to the public .
in addition to enabling middle - income families to have access to facilities and incentives to acquire family computers on a wide scale .
tunisia 's relations with the united states of america are distinguished and traditional . they are based on mutual trust and respect and stem from the eighteenth century , specifically to 1797 , the date of the first commercial agreement between tunisia and the united states .
my visit to this friendly country , for which we have every respect and admiration , undoubtedly falls within the framework of regular and intensive talks and contacts between the officials of both countries , at the highest levels , and forms part of the context of firm relations between the two parties .
we believe that tunisia , by means of its special geographic location as a bridge linking the two banks of the mediterranean , and by means of its legislation and incentives for investors , represents an ideal location for further investment and the establishment of joint ventures .
the message we bring with us springs from tunisia 's past and present . we confirm the firm faith of our country in the values of justice , liberty and democracy and our continuous endeavors to bring about peace and stability in the world on the basis of solidarity and tolerance between nations and peoples , values that we share with the friendly american people .
i note at the outset that there has been no delay in the sphere of democracy and freedom of expression in tunisia , for the construction of every democratic society is inseparable from comprehensive development work
these are two tracts in which we have been keen to make progress with determination and steadfastness , without preferring one to the other . we thus based our method on a rapprochement linking civil and political rights with social , economic and cultural rights , as we knew that human dignity could only be realized by the provision of the means of a dignified life , including the confirmation of the right to health , education , employment , shelter , the protection of the family , children and women , the support of dependent social strata and those having no one to support them , whilst guaranteeing freedom of expression and political and group organization , and consolidating democracy and plurality .
were human opinions in our country not given their weight , their rights not sacrosanct or their dignity not recognized , economic and social development would not have been achieved .
when we adopted a method in establishing the democratic and pluralist structure , fortifying it against every relapse and degeneration , we took into account the failure of the experiments of others and the threats to our country and the stability and development of our society manifest in the dangers posed by the current of those who hide behind religion .
in the sphere of human rights we have made significant progress , which perhaps cannot be enumerated here . we have established institutions and mechanisms that protect them in accordance with a comprehensive and integrated vision of these rights .
the countdown to war , it seems , has begun . our efforts , all of which have so far been directed in one direction , namely to prevent war , must shift to a new direction , namely to spare our dear nation and its dear citizens its effects and consequences .
to protect this nation , its holy sites , security and integrity , your government has taken the following decisions , decisions which i do not doubt , god willing , express your principled position , concur with your commitment to arab and islamic values and will receive your collective approval .
first : the kingdom will not participate in any way in the war on fraternal iraq . its armed forces will not , under any circumstance , enter one inch of iraqi territory .
secondly : we expect the war to end once security council resolution 1441 on the removal of weapons of mass destruction is implemented . we categorically reject any violation of iraq 's unity , independence , resources or internal security , or that it be subject to military occupation . we have notified the government of the united states of our clear saudi position .
thirdly : the exceptional circumstances that have surrounded this crisis for twelve years requires that we should not enter into an uncalculated adventure exposing the safety of our nation and people to danger .
nevertheless , we must say that should events take a course other than that we have explained , or should the war go beyond its declared aim , we will adopt a different stance . every event has its own consideration .
my country has had the honor to chair the general assembly of the arab satellite communications organization ( arabsat ) over the past year .
during this period , in view of your enlightened direction and the unity of all efforts in the organization , notwithstanding their different levels , the organization has achieved significant profits that have exceeded expectations . they are in excess of 74 million dollars , namely an increase of 56% compared with the results for the year 2000 , which confirms the confidence of those dealing with the organization and the soundness of its approach .
your presence here , despite your many concerns , clearly expresses the special concern shown by your government to develop the communications sector and its deep understanding of the strategic role this sector plays in economic and social development in our countries .
the development and advancement of the communications sector is at the heart of the concern of our countries and governments in view of its importance in reducing distances , strengthening links between peoples and nations , facilitating the exchange of information and activating exchange and services to all vital sectors . this will bring massive benefit to all social , economic and cultural activities by benefiting from the most modern technological developments .
there can be no doubt that arabsat , this pioneering arab organization , has played a vital role in bringing the peoples of the arab countries , and these peoples and the peoples of other countries in the world , closer together in view of the many and sophisticated services that it provides at all levels via its satellite systems .
the organization has taken several steps in the right direction .
ladies and gentlemen , allow me also to offer congratulations on behalf of my country to the african committee for human rights and peoples for the professional work that it has carried out to advance and protect the rights of man in our african continent .
the convening of the thirty - first session provides me with an excellent opportunity to confirm once more the adherence of the islamic republic of mauritania to islam and the principles of democracy as determined by the international declaration on human rights and the african charter on human rights and peoples , these two documents that represented the reference for our country 's constitution when it was ratified by a people 's referendum in july 1991 .
this constitution , from which the state of law derived , which protected and strengthened the basic freedoms , formulated a pluralist democracy and guaranteed the independence of the judiciary , thereby giving human rights a constitutional nature , stated that : " the freedom and dignity of man and his right to equality can only be guaranteed in a society that believes in the priority of right . "
in this context , i have the pleasure to mention that since the promulgation of the constitution , the general authorities have worked and are increasing their efforts to strengthen the framework of the application of human rights by localizing and reviewing different laws that explicitly , without ambiguity , express the direction and personal commitment of the president of the republic , mr. mu'aweya wild sayed ahmed taye ' , with the aim of improving the progress and performance of our democracy , incorporating all marginalized groups , improving the status of women , protecting children and involving all civil society in the efforts to develop the country .
here , it is worth pointing out the reforms relating to the administration , judiciary , educational system , electoral system , the funding of political parties , civil status and recent ratification of the law comprising the statutes on personal law , in view of the importance of these reforms in reflecting positively on the improvement of human rights .
i want at the outset to thank you for this warm welcome and the joy with which you greeted us , which is what you have accustomed us to whenever we visit this dear historical city .
the aim of this visit , as was set out in the speech of the mayor , is to lay the foundation stone to rebuild and expand al-naamah airport , making it an international airport capable of receiving large aircraft , as well as inaugurating the launch of the mobile telephone network in the city and opening a tourist complex here .
in a few days time the water project will be inaugurated , and we know that the water network reached this city with large volumes , in excess of the drinking requirements , allowing it to be used in agriculture , factory construction and economic projects .
without electricity , water and means of communications there can be no comprehensive economic development of real value . these means , may god be praised , are now available in the city of al-naamah .
by means of this visit , we wanted to draw the attention of businessmen in al-naamah , the production cooperatives and various patriotic economic activists to the fact that now is the time to move to invest within the country , especially in the city of al-naamah .
i want to thank you from the outset for this warm welcome and the joy with which you have welcomed me .
the welcome was excellent and the joy great , which is what we have grown accustomed to from you , whenever we visit this beautiful district .
the aim of the visit is to contact you and talk with you about national and local issues that concern you and to provide you with information about the achievements realized by our development route .
as you know , the general condition is relatively good .
on the economic level , economic performance is continuously improving and the annual growth rate continues to rise , as the inflation rate falls and the market flourishes .
generally , the state has become economically stronger . there is nothing to cause worry . in fact , all the indications are positive . the reduction in our debt will allow large sums to be made available that will be spent on improving the standard of living for citizens and providing basic social services .
at the outset of this speech i am delighted to pass on the greetings of the president of the islamic republic of mauritania , mr. mu'aweya wild sayed ahmed taye ' , and his wishes for the success and triumph of the business of this summit .
on this occasion , in the name of the president of the republic , i offer warm felicitations to his highness sheikh hamad bin khalifah al thani , for his valuable initiative and the excellent conditions he has made available to ensure the success of this , our summit .
here i would like to offer considerable gratitude to the authorities in the fraternal state of qatar , for the hospitable welcome , the generous hospitality and considerable concern .
likewise , in this context , i can only appreciate the intensive efforts made by the secretary - general of the islamic conference organization mr. abd al-wahid balqziz for the interests of our organization .
this emergency summit , which is being held in circumstance of the major challenge confronting our nation and the great dangers surrounding it , which requires us all to increase cooperation and solidarity .
concerning the iraqi crisis , the matter with which we are dealing today in the framework of this summit , we must exert all possible efforts to avoid the war , an increase in the suffering of the fraternal iraqi people and the exposure of the region to great dangers , and work to find a peaceful solution on the basis of the commitment to international law and the implementation of security council resolutions .
in less than one generation we have witnessed the fastest development of freedom in the narrative of democracy , which extends over two thousand and five hundred years .
in the future historians will provide their interpretations of the causes that led to this happening , but we already know some of the reasons they will mention .
it is no coincidence that this great number of democracies appeared at the same time that the most influential states are themselves democratic .
the united states has made military and moral commitments to europe and asia , protecting the free states from aggression , and created the conditions in which new democracies can flourish .
by our providing security to states in their entirety , we have also provided inspiration to the suppressed peoples , in the prison camps , in the prohibited meetings of the syndicates and in the secret churches .
men and women have come to know that the world does not share in their nightmare .
i have come to you today to put before you four clear facts , by which to note two truths :
the first fact , with which i begin , is that iraq 's long night has ended .
the bitter struggle endured by the iraqis over three decades of cruelty , oppression , tyranny and humiliation ended with the flight of the head of the regime and his followers and the fall of the symbols he had erected across baghdad and the rest of iraq .
the second fact is that the liberation of iraq , and what is taking place is definitely liberation , would not have taken place were it not for the determination shown by president bush , to which the coalition states , at the forefront of which were the united states and the united kingdom , committed .
when we hear the voices of those who are skeptical about the intent of the american and british governments in undertaking the liberation , we only need to call them to visit the collective graves , to visit the dried out marshes and halabja , and to inspect the list of the disappeared , whom the regime deprived of the right to life .
the second fact is that the liberation embodies all iraqi national volition and came as a result of the diligent work performed by the iraqi opposition to the past regime over long years , producing hundreds of thousands of martyrs . the last such will not be ayatollah muhammad baqir al-hakim and his companions , may god have mercy on them all , who drew the line under another page in the record of iraqi heroism last august , the day of the iraqi martyr . nor will it be martyr aqilah al-hashimi , who was reached by the hand of perfidy .
we determined to change and develop and we took the reigns of initiative without hesitation , no matter what the difficulties , so that jordan 's roots would remain firm and unchangeable , in its immediate surroundings and the world . for jordan , in its hashemite message , is jordan the pioneer , the jordan of example and model .
the convening of your noble council today is the completion of institution building in line with the constitution , which confirms your vital , legislative role . through you it also represents the aspirations of the sons and daughters of jordan and embodies their ambitions and the horizons of a prosperous tomorrow .
in line with our promise and our faith in the principle of " jordan first " , your noble council represents the future of our sons and daughters , our children in the desert and the countryside , in the village , the camp and the town . we therefore want it to be a legislative council that is distinguished in its performance , and an authority to which our government can turn whilst drawing up its comprehensive plans and national programs , in order to realize positive change and to meet the aspirations and hopes of our youth , from " jordan first " to jordan now and in the future .
our vision of jordan of the future is established on a firm base . its foundations are that jordan is a modern democratic country and a fundamental part of our arab and islamic nation , to which it is proud to belong and proud of its long - standing hashemite roots .
it is committed with complete conviction to bring out the positive and real image of islam , both doctrine and practice , as part of putting " jordan " forward as a civilized model of tolerance , freedom of thought , innovation and distinction .
here you are , as it would seem from your speeches redolent with the fragrance of jordan , its north and south , its center and east , its valley and highlands , and its wilderness , on the point of fulfilling your national obligations and casting your votes in a public situation , the like of which is infrequent , comprising choices that establish pluralism and liberty , under the monitoring of our people , with the blessing of our self - sacrificing leader , the object of hope and anticipation .
yes , you are about to turn a page to begin the pages of cooperation , integration , monitoring , accountability and consultation .
no one is ignorant of the fact that we are in the same boat . we unite , differ , agree and move apart . it is our one , final and eternal homeland . it is our one , final and eternal throne . it is jordan until god inherits the land and all that is in it .
i agree with the statement that the reality is difficult , that the burden is heavy and that the region is in turmoil .
but this does not make our knees shake or our determination fade . by the leadership of abi al-hussein and the bearer of the al-hussein scepter , glory and banners , we move forward to the fates of men with a natural disposition for confrontation and success .
you have experienced over the past four years the determination of the leader and his will , which is forged from steel , carved from the rock of petra , the spearhead of muatah and the epic of al-yarmuk , and you have seen that what has been achieved in this short time is astonishing and magnificent .
praise to god and peace and blessings on our master , the prophet of god , his family and companions . ladies and gentlemen , noble parliamentarians , with the opening of this parliamentary session , we complete the renewal of constitutional organizations , embodying our firm , royal will in providing a level path for the progress of democracy , as a choice from which there can be no return , no matter how sensitive the national and international challenges .
if we are proud of achieving this qualitative transformation , does this mean that we have reached the goal to which we aspired ?
we have confirmed repeatedly that there can be no democracy without democrats and that democracy is a long hard road . it is not a sham field for a battle over positions . it is a binding citizenship , a practice from which there can be no return , for the best organization of the public interest , especially the local part thereof .
it can only be fortified by establishing the culture of citizenship entrusted to the political parties , the institutions of civil society , and by improving the living conditions of citizens , so that they can be tangibly experienced in daily reality .
whatever the composition of elected councils , we cannot stop asking the fundamental question : is election an end in itself and the end of the road ?
certainly not . respect for the will of the people requires the repudiation of the mentality of the democracy of seats and a commitment to the virtue of developmental democracy .
i am delighted to speak to you at the end of the second national forum for intellectual dialogue , which was recently held close to the sacred mosque in the holy city of makkah , under the title " excess and moderation : a comprehensive methodical vision " . this forum embodied the spirit of islamic and national fraternity and the dialogue took place in an atmosphere of affection and mutual respect .
the forum discussed important studies prepared by experienced specialists dealing with excess in all its forms . the forum concluded by making constructive recommendations that support national unity and strengthen the values of dialogue , moderation and tolerance .
these recommendations will receive the attention from the state that they deserve .
i look forward to the convening of the next forum in the holy city of al-madinah , the city of our prophet and master , muhammad , peace and blessings upon him , to discuss two important topics , namely " education and women " .
in addition to the regular dialogue that takes place in the king abd al-aziz national center , saudi society is now witnessing a broad dialogue including social groups that is taking place via the different forms of media .
dialogue is , in principle , a healthy , positive phenomenon . but we must be extremely careful to avoid the blessing becoming malicious . any dialogue that does not observe the method , rules and protocol of dialogue becomes chaotic . it does not feed the hungry and , rather than being beneficial , causes harm .
in the context of the proceedings taking place in the international court of justice in respect of the legal status of the dividing wall erected by israel in the occupied west bank , the kingdom made its legal statement to the court at the start of the proceedings , by which it emphasized the illegality of the wall and the fact that it represents a clear breach of the fourth geneva convention and all relevant international documents and resolutions .
this wall not only isolates the palestinians , it also represents an obstacle to all the peace initiatives and solutions put forward to create a just solution to the conflict as part of a unilateral step that makes it difficult to reach any future settlement , in addition to its imposing a new reality on the ground , which will increase the complexity of the situation and add new burdens to the fundamental issues of the israeli - palestinian conflict .
in connection with iraq , the kingdom welcomes the results of the fifth conference of neighboring states held in kuwait recently . this included , for the first time , the participation of iraq , thereby making it very important and positive . it also provided the opportunity to find out what iraq needs from its neighbors and what iraq 's neighbors need from it .
the unity of iraqi territory , respect for its sovereignty and independence and the right of the iraqi people to decide their fate and political future were confirmed .
the neighboring states confirmed their willingness to support and maintain all diplomatic and political efforts that aim to achieve the desired goals , which will allow iraq to exercise its positive role as an effective member of the international community and build positive relations with its neighbors , relations in which affection , respect and peace prevail in accordance with the rules of international law and the commitment to international charters .
the formation of a strong and practical partnership between us is highlighted by the facts of history and geography and the dictates of logic .
in addition to the interests arising from the freedom of trade , economic globalization and technological advancement , which have also made it necessary for us to increase frank contact and dialogue in order the better to understand each other .
especially in light of the challenges imposed upon us by the serious events being experienced by our region , which have produced numerous erroneous understandings , suppositions and preconceptions in the political , cultural or religious aspects , which we must confront to avoid their negative impact on our future .
it is my pleasure to present to you today some of the proposals and visions in an endeavor to achieve this aim .
from the outset i wish to stress our firm conviction that change and reform are urgent requirements in the arab world if we want our sincere aspirations for progress and development to be realized .
and that reform must spring from within , in order to guarantee the well being of citizens and to respond to their aspirations for a prosperous society in which the principles of justice and equality in rights and duties prevail .
human development and economic prosperity are the key to a better future for the middle east .
the european union and the arab world can realize great gains by reaching this goal .
any effort in this regard will strengthen our cooperation for the realization of peace and stability in this disturbed part of the world .
it is very important to work to end the occupation and the cycle of violence , extremism and terrorism .
this aim cannot be achieved without a deeper understanding , good intent , the adoption of just policies and the commitment to implement them .
we must not leave the field for the minority of terrorists and extremists to fill the minds of our young people with hate , envy and stereotypes .
of course , a group of states are arguing that the court should not provide any consultative advice on the issue as the united nations general assembly requested .
the argument they put forward is simply the argument that has been put forward in other cases seeking a consultative opinion , in order to suggest that the case is ambiguous , that the court runs the risk of prejudging the negotiations or that it is outside the court 's jurisdiction .
such arguments have failed before this court in the past .
at the same time , it is apparent that one finds these same states adopting the alternative view . they say that the court should not give an opinion , but they continue to stress their stance on the essence of the subject when the court moves to give an opinion .
this is not the issue here .
for example , in the issue of weapons of mass destruction seven states argued in written statements that the court should not give an opinion .
i am delighted to emphasize the distinguished presence of senior officials from the european union , which is helping to launch the first serious and practical step in treating solid waste covering all lebanese regions ( municipalities and villages ) in order to strengthen balanced and just development within the framework of the arla program .
the experiment of municipal work in lebanon is not recent . civil society is familiar with it , has become acquainted with its problems , and is endeavoring to develop it and to expand the scope of its services , in cooperation with the relevant departments and supporting organizations , both local and international .
the lebanese government , in particular the ministry of the interior and municipalities , has become aware of the importance of the work of the municipalities as a local authority administering the public affairs characteristic of civil society , meeting the needs of society , facilitating citizens ' affairs and maintaining public health . this represents a pressing need on the account of the environmental imbalance caused by industrial development . if we do not hurry to deal with the problem of waste , we will face an environmental disaster .
therein lies the importance of cooperation between local departments across borders because knowledge , understanding and development do not know geographical borders . they are the property of all humanity .
by virtue of the major cooperation between officials in the european union and the lebanese government , we are now truly in a stage of creating solutions given that the financial support has been made available . we have moved beyond the stage of proposing problems and their consequences to the stage of study and implementation , which represents a national responsibility of all without exception . it is the duty of organizations elected by the people to bear all their responsibilities as the law has granted them the powers that will enable them to achieve developmental goals that will help in keeping the danger of pollution , from which no one can escape , at bay .
i am delighted to meet the head of the european union commission in lebanon ambassador and friend patrick renauld to sign the protocol of an agreement to fund projects to treat solid waste in the municipalities , which is funded by the " arla " program through a grant by the european union .
the agreement protocol involves the setting up of an independent account to a value of 10.2 million euro ready to fund projects submitted by the municipalities to treat solid waste , administered by the minister of administrative development and monitored by the european union commission .
the signing of this protocol will allow the provision of effective support to municipalities by setting up funding for one of the most important problems confronting them , namely the treatment of solid waste . officials on the municipal councils have frequently declared their desire to treat it as their absolute priority .
this support is available to all lebanon 's municipalities without exception , both municipal unions and groups of municipalities or villages that do not have municipalities . they can all benefit from this project simply by submitting the appropriate files .
these files will be studied and selected by a council that includes representatives of the ministry of the interior and municipalities , the ministry of the environment and the development and construction council .
the agreement protocol refers to the setting up of a specialist unit in the ministry of administrative development equipped with technical and administrative cadres qualified to manage this project .
it is well known that modern development has three pillars : the state , the private sector and civil society .
to the extent that the capacities of the state and the private sector are great , the capacities of civil society are weak .
but there can be no balanced , just and sustainable development without the development of civil society .
on the basis of this view , the european union has decided through an initiative from its ambassador in lebanon , friend patrick renauld , to support lebanese civil society by providing a grant to the value of one million euro allocated for projects prepared by lebanese non - governmental organizations of various kinds , by syndicates and federations of various kinds and by all non - profit making cooperatives .
the value of the funding for each project varies between 25 to 50 thousand euros .
the financial value of this support is not what is important .
i say this because in the context of our review of archaeological sites , discoveries and historical buildings we face the problem of transgression , the problem of protection for transgressors , in a number of regions under various headings . consequently , there is an abuse of archaeological buildings and areas , and transgressions against archaeological sites classified by unesco , which classification is threatened by these transgressions .
by the nature of the situation , we , in lebanon , do not dare to carry out any act unless there is protection provided . if it is carried out by coincidence or greed without prior protection , then retrospective protection is available because we cannot call anyone to account or take a decision against anyone .
we in the ministry of culture , with this legality or without it , send more than one letter over successive weeks concerning transgressions in specific areas . these observations , letters and correspondence result in nothing and the reason is always political interventions in the regions , ministers , personalities , prominent figures and social status .
just the attempt to benefit someone or other , if the situation continues as it is , then in vain do we affirm the legality of a citizen or the legality of a heritage in the general meaning of the word .
good government is an old dream that seduced greece with plato 's " republic " , attracted the arabs with al-farabi in the " virtuous city " and has occupied western thought through the writings of hobbes , montesquieu , hegel and marx .
before good government islam was familiar with the experiment of the " good ancestors " .
in the arabic language the term government came to mean not just the administration of public affairs , as in the case of other languages , but to include the concepts of justice , knowledge and wisdom that prevailed in light of the " good ancestors " .
the arab dream of good government collides with all foreign and domestic challenges .
at the forefront of the foreign challenges we recall the occupation of israel of arab territory and its ongoing military , media , economic and cultural aggression against the arabs , obstructing the path of security , peace and development in the middle east , in addition to the absence of arab solidarity in confronting the occupation , aggression , globalization and fierce economic competition .
at the forefront of the domestic challenges we note the arab deficiency in the context of freedoms , democracy , human rights and equality between men and women , in addition to the prevalence of the curse of poverty , disease , deprivation , unemployment , pollution and information illiteracy .
the male and female trainees to whom we are distributing certificates today embody two complimentary principles that form part of the priorities of any public administration , namely : the development of human resources and the service of citizens .
the ministry of administrative development has , since its inception , worked on two tracts linked to these two principles : the tract of training in the development of human resources in administrative and technological spheres , in addition to training components in special projects , including the projects for plans to improve performance ; and the tract of providing a quality service to citizens that is cost and time effective by spreading a new administrative culture and through a mechanism for simplifying procedures .
i am delighted today to participate with the ministry of finance , specifically the department for tax on built property , in distributing certificates to 68 monitors from all governorates that have trained over ten weeks at a cost of approximately 30 thousand euros , funded by a european union grant as part of the arla project .
i thank first of all the european union in the person of ambassador and friend patrick renauld .
i also thank the finance institute for hosting us and the master plan company for the sound execution of the training .
i single out for thanks the joint working team from the ministries of finance and administrative development for the efforts they have made to make the training process successful .
first , i would like to thank his excellency minister and friend fuad al-saad for launching the " citizen 's law " project , his excellency minister karim baqraduni for monitoring this initiative and members of the working team who strove to produce an initial draft of the citizen 's law on public finance .
the law , by consensus on the concept , is a text that formulates a specific view and determines the obligations by which those concerned are bound with the aim of realizing that view . the law is thus the moral pillar of that view and a tool for realizing it .
on the financial subject , i first hasten here to recall that since the inception of the kernel that we have grown accustomed to referring to as an institution under the name of the state , finance has been its nerves . consequently , taxes and fees represent the basic source for the funds required by the state , in order to facilitate its affairs and to realize and implement the services that citizens in the state expect and demand .
taxes and fees have thus been necessary for all states .
consequently , there has arisen what is termed public finance , which is the subject of the draft law that we are debating .
taxes and fees , which represent the greater part of the sources of public finance , are collected in the name of the citizen and should also be spent for the interest of the citizen .
fraternal lebanon has accustomed us to it being a permanent and renewable forum for thought , education , culture and the sciences . here , today , we witness the opening of an important international forum for presenting and discussing the innovations and tools of modern technology produced by the education and training industry . this comes just one week after we witnessed , at the same location , an arab intellectual forum on education .
there can be no doubt that the issues of education and the development of human resources represent , now more than at any previous time , the most important factors for the development of the country , the consolidation of its scientific presence and the confirmation of its true independence in light of the fierce competitiveness of the world in which we live today .
as part of my contribution i will present some of the inevitable issues of the future , which have become prominent in the form of challenges confronting higher education systems in the arab world , taking into account the influential forces present in the international arena , which have played a fundamental role in formulating these future issues and that challenges of which i will speak .
the first of these forces is the increase in demand for higher education :
as you all know , the speed of economic , scientific and technological change and the knowledge explosion has imposed an increasing demand for higher education and a massive , unprecedented interest in it . this is because the world has passed through a stage of major changes , which have led to the rise of a new society , termed the information society , from which the information economy has risen , the pillar of which is what has been termed the information workforce .
welcome to you at the information symposium on municipal administrative development ( e - municipalities ) , which will shortly begin with the participation of arab and foreign figures and experts from canada , finland , jordan , muscat and lebanon .
the most important foci to be covered by the symposium are :
first focus : " an introduction to e - municipalities " .
second focus : " the legislative legal aspect and electronic financial transfers " .
third focus : " changing from manual work to electronic work " .
fourth focus : " application presentation of a mechanism for e - municipality work " .
we renew the pledge for our heroic martyrs . we also renew the pledge for our intrepid prisoners in the israeli prisons . we say to them that we are keeping our pledge and that your cause is at the top of the list of priorities of the palestinian authority and of the fateh movement . we say to them that dawn is now close , god permitting .
on this occasion we say that our people are subject to the most vicious attack witnessed by a people throughout history , a treacherous aggression with the most modern kinds of weapons . a magnificent steadfastness from this people says to the whole world that we are a people who hold fast to its rights , and that there must be a place for it under the sun , one that is appropriate to it , its struggle and its sacrifices .
the loyal cadres , men and knights of fateh were always worthy of the responsibility entrusted to them . they constantly renewed the blood and they renew the determination and insistence to continue the path of their leaders , those who died along the way or remain potential martyrs , fateh 's cadres and knights to the pledge .
we have complete confidence that fateh is capable of continuing to renew its blood , capable of giving , justice and equality among its cadres , capable of spreading a democratic atmosphere in its ranks . god willing , it is on the threshold of a new stage , in the wake of this magnificent steadfastness and intrepid struggle , into which the masses of our people plunged under the leadership of the fateh movement .
to our cadres we say be sure that the fateh movement is your movement , a movement of giving , a movement of fighters , a movement not of those who come first , but of those who are truthful .
as for this tragic and bitter reality from which our people suffer and which they live on a daily basis , we are in awe of you , dear people . each one of you , by means of his position , work and relations , individually and collectively , sending the voice of your just people and its just cause , and the war , terror , aggression , violations and bloody raids at the hands of the forces of the occupying army and the settlers , who continue to plunder and steal our territory , annex it , establish more centers of colonial settlements and expand and develop those already existing .
israeli talk about evacuating some of these settlements sites only serves to throw dust in the eyes and to deceive international public opinion .
all of this is taking place in an organized fashion , with the aim of legalizing and establishing their occupation of our land and our holy places , of depriving our people of embodying the sacred right to return , to self - determination , to the establishment of its palestinian state with jerusalem as its noble capital , by changing our areas into isolated " second - hand markets " between which there can be no link .
it is a much worse situation than the system of " apartheid " applied in south africa , not to mention the military and settlement checkpoints set up in the streets , roads and mountain peaks , at the entry to every village , town and camp , which exceed 750 in number .
to you , for you , the fraternal lebanese people and his excellency president emil lahud every greeting , respect and love .
today you are going out on this popular march , which includes all the lebanese political parties and all the fraternal children of lebanon , to declare in your name , and that of fraternal lebanon , in fact in the name of all brother arabs , and in the name of all free and noble people in the whole world , that the people of lofty , proud and fraternal lebanon stand beside their brothers , the palestinian people , in their just struggle against the occupation , against settlement , against the sinful military escalation and against the daily crimes against our children , women and people , against our infrastructure and our institutions , and against the wall of annexation , expansion and racial division .
in order that the palestinian people might obtain its freedom , independence and sovereignty in its independent palestinian state with its noble capital of jerusalem , god willing . for the right of palestinian refugees to return to their homeland , land and homes from which they were stripped by force and aggression . for the defense of our christian and islamic holy places and for the release of the heroic prisoners and detainees .
from here , and from the heart of the siege imposed on our palestinian people and its legitimate leadership , i say to you , dear lebanese brothers , i thank you from the heart with affection .
on this historic day , the palestinian people , alongside all the noble people in the world , hopes to hear the word of international law , the word of human justice , the word of international legitimacy . the international court of justice is meeting in the hague pursuant to a resolution of the united nations general assembly in order to give its opinion on the building of the wall of annexation , expansion and racial discrimination that the government of israel is establishing on our palestinian land .
the acme of this tragedy lies in the construction of this wall of expansion , occupation , settlement and racism , which has changed our towns , villages and camps into prisons and mass detention camps . by what right are our people deprived of its territory and imprisoned in these ghettoes built by the government of israel ?
at the same time its occupying army , with the settlers , perpetrates all manner of terror , aggression and murder against our people and our territory , destroys all our infrastructure , digs up our agricultural land , our farms and our homes , seizes our subterranean water and seizes our tax and customs duties over more than three years to the present date !
here is our people , a patient , steadfast and mighty people , despite the daily crimes committed against it by the israeli occupying army , its tanks , its artillery , its missiles , its aircraft and its internationally banned weapons . these inhuman and tragic circumstances , which no other people in the whole world has previously experienced .
the reality is that the peace process has entered a dark tunnel and one that will go on . but we have maintained our true vision of peace to serve our palestinian people , our arab nation and the region in its entirety on the basis of the saudi initiative adopted by the arab summit in beirut .
peace is a certain interest of the palestinian people , just as security and peace are certain interests of the israeli people , especially the peace forces and those from the nation of moses who are guided by right along the straight path . you saw how in the hague the rabbis and peace forces stood , and marched in jerusalem and elsewhere , alongside you against what is happening to the palestinian people .
our political position springs from the interest of our people and from a deep understanding of the facts and variables that , in turn , affect our palestinian situation , our arab situation , the situation of the entire arab nation and the peace process in the whole region .
from this we hold fast and declare today before our revolutionary council that the fateh movement will hold fast to the option for a just , permanent and comprehensive peace , to the negotiations and to all the resolutions of international law , the most recent of which is the road map , which today represents the various effective forces of international law and has now been approved pursuant to the russian initiative in the security council .
the steadfast , united palestinian people today commemorates " international women 's day " on march 8 , thereby confirming its firm , strong conviction and belief that palestinian society rejects all forms of discrimination against women .
the only discrimination affirmed by our people is positive discrimination for the interests of women , for their full participation , to enable them to play a fundamental role in forming the national future , alongside men , with equal rights , duties and opportunities . this was confirmed by the document declaring palestinian independence . palestinian women protect our continued survival and represent the permanent protector of our flame .
palestinian women have made their journey to full equality in the right to education , the right to work in all spheres of life , and likewise in the fields of freedom and the arenas of struggle , steadfastness and resoluteness of our people , since the beginning of the twentieth century and in confronting " sykes - picot " .
women participate effectively in public life , in organizations , syndicates and associations ; in the different facets of social , economic , educational , cultural , political and struggle activity ; in the process of decision making on the national level , whether in the " palestinian national council " , the " central " or the " legislative council " ; and in executive leadership roles in the " executive committee " and the " cabinet " , where there is a special ministry for the affairs of palestinian women .
this , in turn , is an indication of the acknowledgement and affirmation by society of the effective role of women in making national decision and the complete concern for women 's issues , in order to remove all forms of discrimination against them , in full cooperation with the " palestinian women 's general federation " and all the various female frameworks and formations .
i look to all those who love democracy in the world to assist our people establish and renew its democratic life , far removed from occupation , checkpoints and the wall of annexation , expansion and racial division . we here confirm that palestinian democracy and the independent palestinian state with its capital jerusalem represent the true guarantee of security , peace and good neighborliness between us and the israelis , and in the entire region .
the continuation of the israeli occupation and the oppression , murder , destruction , suppression , the building of settlements , the siege and the checkpoints transforming our land and towns into detention camps will not build bridges of trust and will not provide good ground on which to establish true security and peace .
good neighborliness between the two peoples will not be achieved by the construction of the wall of annexation , expansion and racial discrimination , which , according to their maps , will swallow up 58% of our palestinian territory and turn jerusalem , the capital of the palestinian state , and its islamic and christian holy sites , into a ghetto surrounded by a wall and barbed and electric wires . palestinians are prohibited from entering their holy city , jerusalem , and praying in the al-aqsa mosque and the church of the resurrection . the historic and religious road for worshippers between jerusalem and bethlehem and the church of the nativity of christ , peace upon him , is closed in their faces .
the events in hebron and abraham 's sanctuary . the events in nablus and the old historic town . they do not even respect their own history . our master joseph and his father lived there before traveling to egypt . locusts in jenin and rafeh . the military escalation , destruction , assassinations and detentions in all the west bank and the gaza strip , pursuant to their military plan , termed the " foreign game " , which they have declared officially . it began with the al-buraij and al-nasirat massacre , and yesterday in jenin . no one knows what there will be today and tomorrow . but between them and us there is much time .
brothers : the bombings in riyadh and the arrest of wanted men in al-madinah and makkah , and other such events that occurred in the kingdom recently , are matters that require questions and reflection , and enquiry into the causes . why do such acts happen and what are the elements of the motivations behind them ?
how can they be an ideology and approaches that in no way accord with the reality of a nation governed by god 's law in its approach , which has chosen gods ' book and the practice of his prophet , may the peace and blessings of god be upon him , as a constitution by which to judge word and deed ?
are the criminal acts that we have witnessed those of young nationals who targeted people to kill , property to sabotage and families to terrorize ?
was the source of this an ideology that sprung from this land , an imported ideology or the product of deception by a gang whose intellect had not yet matured ; or does it stem from several causes , with several parties at home and abroad ? and how strong is this ideology and how far has it spread ?
brothers , there must be research into these and other questions in order that we answer them , to examine the problem of those who have abandoned the nation in its straight path , chosen the ways of satan and deviated from the truth .
in my view or understanding the problem does not lie in criminal acts perpetrated by a criminal as a result of criminal desires or tendencies . it is bigger than this . it is a problem of convictions . if an error is carried out in the conviction that it is right , we must look to the roots , roots that are convictions , the construction of beliefs and the formulation of approaches .
as we open the proceedings of the eighth legislative session of your noble council , i can only pass on to you my heartfelt congratulations at the great trust placed in you by citizens from different social groups , in order that you might be their genuine representatives and trustees of their interests , the interest of the nation , and its future and fate .
how great is my pleasure at congratulating you on the fortieth anniversary of the glorious march 8 revolution , from which sprang the blessed corrective movement that promised and fulfilled . this was the convening of the first council of the people about thirty two years ago , which was followed in a regular manner by successive legislative cycles , thereby providing practical embodiment of the democracy that springs from our heritage and is appropriate to our circumstances .
the previous seven cycles have completed widespread business in the sphere of legislation and monitoring , and enacted many of the laws by which we have achieved a major renaissance on all levels .
notwithstanding any academic or scientific definition of the meaning of revolution as a fundamental change to something , or complete transformation in the progress of history , for me , actual revolution is an on - going reality that follows that fundamental change . it is an on - going condition of development and progress for the better .
the industrial revolution , for example , did not happen in a day , some days or some years .
the same applies to the digital revolution , which arose in the 1980s , and which has continued with great momentum to our present time .
the celebration of a specific day is thus a symbol of this change , but progress and development are a continuation of that day .
madam president , we warmly welcome you to head this session .
this concern reflects your personal interest and that of your friendly country , chile , to confront and limit the major challenges facing future generations .
welcome to you .
we would like to thank the executive director of the united nations children 's organization , carol bellamy , and the special representative of the secretary - general , otunnu olara , for their valuable statements at the start of this session .
we confirm that their content assists in making progress to confront the challenge represented in the suffering of children during armed conflicts .
my delegation has examined the report of the secretary - general put forward before us . we believe that it should receive the attention of us all .
at the beginning , madam president , i wish to express the appreciation of egypt 's delegation to you and your friendly country , for chairing this important session . i also want to thank the secretary - general and his special representative , mr. olara otunnu , for their valuable efforts and contributions in strengthening and protecting the rights of children during armed conflicts .
i also want to praise the efforts made by mrs. carol bellamy , executive director of the united nations children 's organization ( unicef ) , in the field of strengthening and protecting the rights of the child , and to confirm to you my country 's full commitment to support all efforts made in this regard .
for a number of years the council has shown special concern for the matter of refugee and internally - displaced children who are forced to flee their homes , as well as children who are sexually recruited and exploited , giving special importance to girls , in view of the fact that they are more exposed to additional dangers , notably sexual violence .
this is a praiseworthy endeavor of the council , one that is supported by my country , which hopes that it will continue .
however , i wish to turn the attention of the distinguished council to a category of children that has been overlooked , namely children under foreign occupation , in particular the children in the occupied palestinian territories , who die on a daily basis as a result of the continuing violations of human rights and the unjust use of violence .
it is sufficient to cast a glance over the numbers of child victims as a result of the on - going conflict in order to perceive the importance of dealing with this matter and of shedding light thereon .
allow me to thank you for holding this open session and providing the opportunity once more to member states to express their views and concerns on the matter of dealing with the issue of the illegal trade in small and light weapons .
we also thank the secretary - general for the report submitted in this regard .
i would also like to thank and express appreciation for mr. abeh , deputy secretary - general for disarmament , for presenting the report of the secretary - general .
the 2001 united nations conference confirmed that the illegal trade in small and light weapons was a complex and difficult issue in view of the threat it represents to the lives of innocents , especially children , women and the elderly , who were the victims of these weapons . this led us to call on all states , especially the states manufacturing and exporting these weapons , to make every possible effort , by means of international cooperation , to put an end to this tragedy and find beneficial remedies therefor .
the dimensions of the disastrous damage arising from the issue of small and light weapons in the conflicts witnessed and being witnessed by some states of the continent of africa have become clear . other regions are witnessing similar conflicts .
on this occasion we reiterate our demand for all states to respect the resolutions for the prohibition imposed by security council resolutions on the export of small and light weapons to african states witnessing armed conflict .
i have the pleasure to welcome among us mr. jose ramos - horta , foreign minister of timor - leste .
we wish him , his government and his people every success in building their emerging country .
i am delighted to express our thanks to the secretary - general of the united nations , mr. kofi annan , for his special report on the united nations mission to support timor - leste , and also to mr. jan marie kamalesh sharma , the personal representative of the secretary - general in timor - leste . you deserve every appreciation .
the special report of the secretary - general provides a comprehensive presentation of all the important developments witnessed by timor - leste since it obtained its independence , the achievements realized in the field of reconstruction and the challenges that remain there .
allow us to confirm the veracity of the contents of numerous statements made referring to the fact that timor - leste is one of the united nations ' success stories as a result of the close monitoring achieved by the efforts of the general assembly and its special committee on decolonization , the work undertaken by the security council or the efforts made by the secretariat general of the united nations .
syria 's delegation supports the contents of the report that the political institutions in timor - leste have continued to develop and that the development achieved is admirable .
i thank you , mr. president , for convening this session .
we congratulate you on assuming presidency of the council for this month , and wish you every success .
we thank the chilean delegation for its successful leadership of the work of the council last month .
my delegation thanks the secretary - general for his interim report on the implementation of the recommendations prepared by the security council mission sent to central africa , in which my delegation had the honor to participate .
the report put forward before the council established the importance of the missions sent by the council to areas of conflict , the importance of which is increased when they are subsequently accompanied by intensive work to implement the recommendations reached .
my delegation is satisfied at the implementation of a major part of the recommendations of the mission that visited central africa in the period from june 7-16 , 2003 .
in particular those that relate to the setting up of interim institutions in the democratic republic of congo in a number of important and sensitive areas , notably the naming of the members of the interim government by the eight bodies and entities that participated in the dialogue between the congolese parties , and the approval by the council of ministers of a comprehensive range of general political objectives , including the formation of an integrated national army and an integrated national police force .
the interim report of the secretary - general on the progress achieved in implementing the recommendations of the united nations mission sent to the region of central africa reflects a truth that the delegation of egypt would , today , like to highlight before the security council , namely : notwithstanding the existence of evidence for the movement of conditions in both the democratic republic of congo and burundi in a positive direction , the challenges facing the restoration of peace in its full sense for these two countries , and for the region of the great lakes generally , remain great .
more efforts should be made to confront them .
in this context our delegation wishes to make the following observations :
first , it is important to acknowledge that dealing with the post - conflict stage in the region of central africa requires a " participation " between the interim government , the united nations , relevant regional and international forces , the african federation , sub - regional organizations and the community of international donors .
such " participation " should rely on the principle of " integration and balance of responsibilities " between the partners .
we now have a clear vision of the needs and demands of the stages of making , maintaining and building peace in the region . they are needs and demands that go beyond the limited security concept of peace to a broader list of interlinked and interrelated political , humanitarian , economic and social elements . they require the establishment of an integrated range of aid , incentives and pressures , which may be difficult to translate into a practical reality without the realization of the " partnership " required .
the subject of " post - armed conflict national reconciliation " is of clear importance in the context of dealing with the future role of the united nations in the spheres of making , maintaining and building peace .
one cannot diminish the pivotal nature of the element of national reconciliation in rebuilding societies that have experienced the bitterness of armed conflicts , and the consequences thereof for the social fabric and economic infrastructure , in specific states and regions ; and in enabling them to turn the page of the past and look to a future of peaceful co - existence and cooperation , and a sense of common goal and interests .
in our estimation the role of the united nations in the process of national reconciliation should take into account a number of issues and elements , as follows :
first , the processes of national reconciliation are , by their nature , long - term , the major part of which lies within the context of the concept of " building peace " . this is despite the fact that the process of setting up the institutional structure to administer it begins at an early stage of the " maintaining peace " stage .
at the same time as the characteristics of the immediate role of the united nations in the sphere of maintaining peace have begun to be formed pursuant to the report of the " al-ibrahimi committee " , the role of the organization in the sphere of building peace requires greater definition and guidance for an examination of the practical framework for united nations contributions in the sphere of national reconciliation .
secondly , the requirements and elements of the processes of national reconciliation differ according to the nature of the struggle under consideration and the historical , cultural , social , political and economic dimensions relevant to the outbreak of the conflict .
mr. president , we thank you for holding this meeting to examine the interim report of the secretary - general on the progress achieved in implementing the recommendations of the security council mission sent to west africa , in which syria had the honor to participate .
we also express our appreciation to the deputy secretary - general , mr. calumet , for his presentation of the interim report of the secretary - general , in which he covered the steps taken , or those to be taken , to implement the recommendations of the security council mission to genya - bissau , the ivory coast , liberia and sierra leone .
our delegation is satisfied at the return of calm to genya - bissau and the pledge by the interim president and the interim government to conduct legislative elections within the period provided for in the interim charter , or before such time , pursuant to the recommendation of the national electoral committee .
we add our voice to the voice of the secretary - general to the effect that there is a pressing need for the participation of the international community in order to provide financial and other support to enable the local authorities to fulfill their obligations .
in respect of the ivory coast , we agree with the secretary - general that the linas - marcoussis agreements should be implemented as soon as possible by all parties , in accordance with the recommendation of the council 's mission sent to the region , in addition to the recommendation made in paragraph 31 of its report .
our delegation expresses its satisfaction at the action by president gbagbo , prime minister diarra and the new forces to implement some of these recommendations in an interim and successive manner .
i promise to adhere to the five minutes set for each speaker , even if i have to stop giving the written text of my statement .
i wish , mr. president , to speak about a number of points as egyptian follow - up to the interim report submitted by the secretary - general on the progress achieved in implementing the recommendations of the mission of the security council sent to west africa .
first , the concern to support cooperation and raise the capabilities of the economic group of west african states represents the cornerstone in sub - regional treatment of the issue of security and peace in this region .
there can be no doubt that the group has provided a model worthy of appreciation of autonomous african capabilities in the spheres of making and maintaining peace over recent years , starting from sierra leone , continuing with genya - bissau and the ivory coast , and concluding with liberia .
this is in spite of the limited technical and market capabilities available to them .
we agree with the contents of the report in respect of the necessity of creating an effective formula for assisting the group to overcome the obstacles it faces in continuing its distinguished performance in preventing the outbreak of armed conflicts , and in resolving them and maintaining peace .
i would like to offer thanks to all the delegations that supported the draft resolution on providing aid to the palestinian people , which was adopted a short time ago by a massive majority .
we wish also to express our thanks to the states that adopted and submitted this important draft to the general assembly .
i would also like to express our appreciation and gratitude in this regard to all the donor states , agencies of the united nations , regional committees and non - governmental organizations that have generously contributed humanitarian and other aid to the palestinian people in the occupied palestinian territories , including east jerusalem .
our people , who live in very difficult conditions that are tantamount to a humanitarian disaster , are very grateful to them all .
at the same time , there is no need to say that most of the assistance is coming on the basis of humanitarian assistance as opposed to assistance for economic development , which is primarily due to the terrible conditions created by the force occupying the palestinian people .
consequently , the pressing issue is to change these conditions in a manner that will allow a genuine process of economic development .
allow me to make some of our observations on the issue submitted before us today .
first , the effectiveness and credibility of the security council springs not just from its being a mechanism chosen by the world more than half a century ago to maintain international peace and security , but also from it countering the new challenges to peace and security on the regional and international levels , and by its interacting with them and its development in confronting them .
therefore , the council 's awareness of the seriousness of the issue of the illegal trade and spread of small and light weapons and the humanitarian consequences thereof over recent years requires that the council move to confront this challenge in a serious and effective manner , one that is appropriate to the danger arising therefrom .
secondly , the interaction between the security council and the general assembly is essential in tackling the issues relating to the illegal spread of small and light weapons , and in formulating and implementing an effective and long - term strategy to confront it .
in this regard , the general assembly made commendable progress in its recommendation at the end of december 2003 to form a working team with open membership to study and draft an international document to stamp and make an inventory of illegal small and light weapons .
we hope that the works of this team during 2004-2005 will meet with the desired success , thereby ensuring firm international cooperation to prohibit and put an end to the illegal trade in small and light weapons .
mr. president , we have been keen to participate in today 's session out of a belief in the importance of the dialogue taking place and continuing in the different frameworks of the united nations concerning the threats posed by international terrorism to the facets of the life of the international community , including its peace , security and economic and social development and progress , and the unity of will of all states required to confront it and secure broad - based international cooperation to confront all aspects of this danger .
allow me to present the following points , which we believe are fundamental to our debate today .
first , the issue of terrorism forcefully imposed itself on the agenda of the united nations by virtue of it being an international threat , one that did not discriminate or distinguish between countries , peoples , religions or cultures .
egypt was , and remains , at the forefront of those states that stressed that terrorism was an international phenomenon and that , consequently , to confront it required a balanced collective movement , one that would avoid unilateral measures and provoking the hostility of cultures , civilizations or religions .
secondly , the counter - terrorism committee has succeeded over the last two years in confirming once more that the united nations , with its different organs , has the ability to confront decisively and effectively the developing international threats .
on this basis egypt was quick to cooperate with the committee and to provide it with reports which , to date , number three .
