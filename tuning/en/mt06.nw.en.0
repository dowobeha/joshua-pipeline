roed - larsen : middle east a " powder keg with lit fuse "
oslo 2-6 ( afp ) - terje roed - larsen , the former united nations middle east envoy , considered the situation in the region as having never been as dangerous as it is today and compared the region to a " powder keg with a lit fuse " .
roed - larsen , speaking to the norwegian nrk radio station said that " the region can now be compared in several respects to a powder keg with a lit fuse . "
he added " i think the situation is more difficult , complicated and dangerous than it has been for a number of decades . "
among the existing and potential crises in the middle east , roed - larsen mentioned the arab - israeli dispute , the iranian nuclear portfolio and the crisis between lebanon and syria .
he said that " all this brings us back to issues of fundamental values and opinions which make the situation more likely to get out of control at any moment than it has been in the last few days . "
roed - larsen did not openly mention the acts of violence that permeated demonstrations in the muslim world in protest against the publication of caricatures of the prophet muhammad in the european press , limiting himself to emphasizing the need for " dialogue " rather than " throwing stones and lighting fires . "
demonstrators set fire to the danish and norwegian embassy buildings in damascus on saturday while a building housing the danish embassy in beirut was set on fire in response to the publication of the caricatures in september in the danish newspaper jyllands - posten and their subsequent republication in the european media , led by the norwegian magazine magazinet .
roed - larsen is currently in charge of monitoring the implementation of security council resolution 1559 which stipulates the disarmament of militias and armed groups in lebanon , including , in the international organization 's opinion , the lebanese shiite hezbollah and palestinian groups .

belgian mayor bans display of artwork depicting saddam hussein
brussels 2-7 ( afp ) - the mayor of middelkerke in west belgium michel landuyt told agence france presse that he decided to ban a controversial piece of art depicting the ousted iraqi president saddam hussein in chains by the avant - garde czech artist david cerny , saying it was " shocking " .
landuyt , mayor of a small belgian seaside town , justified his decision on monday by saying that " this artwork could shock some people , not just the local inhabitants but also tourists and perhaps people of other faiths , especially muslims . "
however , he said the artwork had been done over a year ago and was " unrelated " to the publication of caricatures of the prophet muhammad in europe , which has led to a wave of condemnation and violence in the muslim world in the past few days .
the artwork entitled " shark " shows saddam hussein handcuffed and suspended in a tank filled with liquid .
it was to be shown at the 2006 beaufort arts festivals .
michel landuyt said , " in my view , ( the piece ) was shocking . " he pointed out that saddam hussein is currently standing trial , with the proceedings being shown on television .
" shark " was shown for the first time at the prague 2 international exhibition , held every two years and which took place between may and september 2005 .
david cerny ( 38 years old ) is famous for his provocative pieces such as " flag on poles " which symbolizes the migration of east germans to the west in 1989 .
in october 2004 , prague 's municipal council backed down from erecting a memorial to the anti - nazi resistance movement designed by him because it was regarded as being offensive to world war ii veterans .
hamas formally invites fatah to participate in government .
cairo 2-7 ( afp ) - the leader of the parliamentary bloc of the islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) ismail haniya announced that the movement , which won the legislative elections at the end of january , will formally invite the fatah movement led by mahmoud abbas to participate in the government .
haniya said , after a meeting on monday evening with the head of egyptian intelligence general omar suleiman , " we will sit down with them ( fatah movement ) and formally invite them to participate in this government . "
he added in statements reported by the official egyptian middle east news agency , " we are waiting for a formal response from the fatah movement 's general command . "
a number of fatah leaders expressed their opposition to participating in the government hamas is expected to form but an official decision has not yet been issued with regard to this matter .
haniya said , " we told omar suleiman that hamas wants dialogue with all the palestinian political parties and we discussed the international pressures and threats to cut aid to the palestinian people . "
he added , " we stressed that all these situations oppress the rights of our people but we have alternatives , be they palestinian , arab or islamic . "
he went on to say , " we also discussed how to galvanize the palestinian liberation organization , given that the legislative elections are the first step and will be followed by a second step relating to the palestinian diaspora . "
a hamas delegation began talks in cairo relating to forming a new palestinian government . after the movement 's leadership held two meetings , it met with suleiman this evening and will meet with him again on tuesday .

head of israel 's internal security service warns of " jewish terrorism "
jerusalem - 2-7 ( afp ) - the head of israel 's internal security service ( shin bet ) , yuval diskin , warned of the dangers of " jewish terrorism " in an interview with young settlers in the west bank shown on israeli television 's channel 2 on monday night .
diskin told students at a religious institute for semi - military training , " i 'm telling you quite openly that if a jew carries out a terrorist act , he will be considered a cancer in the state and represents a much bigger threat than hamas " , referring to the islamic resistance movement .
diskin made these statements around a month ago but his speech , recorded a month ago , was not shown until monday night on israeli " channel 10 " .
he added , " i want to tell you that we will pursue with equal severity a jewish terrorist who kills an arab or an arab who kills a jew . " however , he admitted that an arab would " receive harsher treatment than a jew committing the same acts . "
he expressed his deep concern about the " fundamentalist streak " among young settlers who are being drawn into violence to express their opposition to the dismantling of settlements .
on another front , diskin said that the collapse of iraqi president saddam hussein 's regime was , in the end , " damaging to israel " because " chaos reigns in iraq " .
tens of thousands of settlers and far - right supporters demonstrated in west jerusalem on sunday evening under the slogan " olmert is bad for israel " referring to the acting prime minister .
they wrote on one of the banners " olmert is leading us into civil war " in a reference to the dismantling of nine houses built in the settlement of amouna near ramallah on the west bank .
clashes took place between settlers and police officers during the dismantling process and resulted in 200 wounded , most of them suffering minor injuries .

iranian official : merkel " thinks she is hitler "
tehran 2-8 ( afp ) - an official in the revolutionary guard , the iranian regime 's ideological army , condemned recent statements by german chancellor angela merkel concerning the iranian nuclear portfolio , deeming that " she thinks she is hitler " .
commander sayyed massoud al-jazairi said in statements today , wednesday , " in her childhood dreams , merkel thought she was hitler and she now thinks , as she holds the position of chancellor , that she can impose her will on the world and on free nations . "
the head of the revolutionary guard 's public relations ' department added , in statements made to the iranian students news agency , " we cannot expect anything else from people who have a zionist past " .
merkel had said on saturday at a conference on security held in munich that " iran has intentionally crossed the red line " with regard to its nuclear program and should accept negotiations based on the russian proposal .
merkel called on iran to " seize the opportunity while it is still there " . she said , " we want , and it is our duty to do so , to prevent iran from developing nuclear weapons " in a speech on german defense policy .
jazairi said that " the way in which the europeans are acting on the iranian nuclear portfolio shows the weakness and powerlessness of countries like france , germany and britain . "
he said that " european nations must ask themselves why their leaders , especially france , britain and germany , are behaving as though they are the servants of an american cowboy " , in reference to american president george bush .
jazairi said , " i promise you that the childish jubilation of american officials and the zionist regime following the referral of the nuclear portfolio to the security council will not last . "
hamas rejects what some fatah groups see as exposing the palestinian national project to danger
by taher al-majthoub
( repeat with clarification in the fourth paragraph )
ramallah ( west bank ) 2-8 ( afp ) - a number of circles in the fatah movement have expressed their fears that the palestinian national project may be exposed to danger with the islamic resistance movement hamas taking over the reins of the palestinian authority . however , the islamic movement vehemently rejected this suggestion .
adnan al-dhumeiri , a fatah leader in the west bank , told the france presse news agency that " hamas , as part of the worldwide muslim brotherhood movement , is not as concerned with questions of palestinian statehood as it is with the issue of islamic nationhood . "
he said that " the other side is that the hamas resistance movement can be compared to the taliban and chechen movements and this is what sets it apart from other islamic movements in the arab and muslim world , but hamas has not carried out any operations outside the borders of palestine . "
al-dhumeiri , who was a fatah movement candidate in the recent elections but did not win , viewed the differences between hamas and fatah as " fatah has an agenda that stipulates continued negotiation efforts to establish a palestinian state in the west bank and gaza strip with east jerusalem as its capital based on the 1967 border . fatah sees this solution as strategic while hamas sees it as being a stage . "
on the same note , a palestinian official who wished to remain anonymous said that hamas " belongs to an islamic movement that is not as concerned with establishing a state as much as it cares about establishing an islamic caliphate and so its interests may coincide with those of tehran and damascus . it is a candidate for alliance with hizbollah in lebanon and iran and with the muslim brotherhood in other countries in the world . "
he added , " even syria may make use of it within the framework of its policy aimed at using the palestinian and lebanese causes as a card to pressurize israel , especially as the baath party also regards the statehood question as a joint one in terms of arab nationalism . "
in the end , if hamas agrees to a ceasefire with israel for a period of 10 or 15 years , it may back down on the issue of liberation and focus on imposing an islamic agenda on society , according to him .
more than one hamas official has said that the islamic movement is preparing to set up a new palestinian government ready to enter into a long - term ceasefire with israel .
in an interview with france presse , hamas deputy mahmoud al-ramhi strongly denied that hamas might be endangering the palestinian national agenda .
he said , " this claim is not based on truth and israel 's unilateral policy began before hamas won , when fatah was in power , because the oslo accords ( 1994 ) did not specify when the settlements would end nor the borders of the palestinian state " , and consequently the movement bears no responsibility in terms of endangering the palestinian agenda .
he also added that israel had decided , within the framework of the same unilateral policy , " to withdraw from the gaza strip and build the separation wall before hamas won , and even before the date the legislative elections were set and before hamas ' decision to take part in them " . he stated that " israel does not comply with any of the agreements reached and negotiation has not put an end to this . the only solution is to carry on the resistance . "
the head of the hamas movement 's political bureau , khalid mashaal , announced today , wednesday , that the movement could well comply with a " long ceasefire " with israel in the event of it withdrawing to the 1967 borders and " recognizing the rights of " the palestinians .
al-ramhi said , " the ceasefire with its conditions are the creation of a palestinian state with the 1967 borders including east jerusalem and the release of detainees " . he said that " if we cannot achieve these conditions and if israel does not release any prisoners and does not withdraw from the west bank , then hamas will not be bound by the cairo agreement . "
ahmed sadat , secretary - general of the popular front for the liberation of palestine , told france presse from prison in jericho , " we are not afraid of any palestinian side abandoning the palestinian project because the battle is essentially against israeli occupation and we have not heard about the hamas movement abandoning any of the fundamental principles of the palestinian cause nor of it being under any allegiance or program . " . "
he said that " the commitment to these principles and resisting occupation are common denominators " and " the resistance is linked to the existence of occupation . "
sadat added , " we look forward to what hamas has to offer . what is needed from all forces in palestinian society is a democratic vision and internal consensus as an initial step in electing members of the legislative council . the second step is in the form of our citizens abroad taking part through direct elections . "
it should be pointed out that both the popular front and hamas reject the oslo accords and the road map plan .
bassam al-salihi , a deputy with the parliamentary alternative bloc ( people 's party , left wing ) said that " it is premature to come out with general or hasty conclusions for a number of reasons , one of which is that hamas ' victory does not necessarily mean a loss of political balance . "
he called for " a review of the results because support for hamas in the palestinian street is no more than half the electorate , 40% " , adding that " i think the liberation organization 's program , independence , international legitimacy and the arab peace initiative , are backed by the majority on the palestinian street . "
al-salihi said , " it 's hard for any political movement to reach agreements that do not live up to this program . "
al-salihi pointed out that his bloc " is thinking about proposing a draft project to the legislative council or the central committee declaring the 1967 border as the border for the palestinian state with jerusalem as its capital and calling for the world to recognize this [ . . . ] because the issue of borders is not a matter for negotiation but a matter of dispute . "
al-salihi stated that " we believe that the priority is to rebuild the palestinian democratic movement on clearer bases in the political and social context and that the foundation must be the independence pact because this is what defines a social vision of the political system based on a secular system . "
suzuki to shortly announce its future in the world rally championship
tokyo 2-8 ( afp ) - japanese company suzuki has said that it will shortly announce its plans to take part in the world rally championship without disclosing details about the matter .
david farquhar , press director and head of the japanese company 's public relations division , said that the announcement would be made on the fringes of the geneva car exhibition at the end of this month .
many world rally championship circles have said that suzuki might join the list of official manufacturers as of next year . it currently takes part in the junior wrc with a swift s 1600 and won the swedish rally , the first stage in this class and second stage in the wrc championship with its swedish driver pier - gunnar andersson .
suzuki has taken part in many rallies outside these classes , in preparation for formally joining the adult class in the world championship . these expectations were reinforced by its announcement today that it is to make a decision on this matter on the 28th of this month ( 2 o'clock geneva time ) .
if it decides to take part , this will constitute strong backing for the championship , especially since two french companies citroen - world champion for the past three years - and peugeot , japanese mitsubishi , czech skoda and korean hyundai have backed out of formal participation .
citroen will return to the world championship next year with a new car , the c4 , in place of the xsara , although it offers semi - official support for the belgian company kronos racing ( citroen xsara ) and its driver , frenchman sebastien loeb , world champion for the last two years , and his spanish colleague xavier pons . it also backs fellow citizen daniel sordo , champion of the junior wrc champion last year and who is following in loeb 's footsteps who was crowned champion in this class before moving onto the adult class .
the number of official manufacturers in the championship will rise to four in the event of suzuki joining and citroen returning next year , alongside subaru and ford which won the first two stages of the championship this year with its new driver , finnish marcus gronholm . other participants in the special events include the finn tony gardemeister ( astra racing - peugeot 307 ) who was absent from the swedish rally after winning third place in monaco , frenchman gilles panizzi ( red bull - skoda ) and the italian gigi galli who is taking part privately ( mitsubishi lancer w 2005 ) .
israeli minister views putin 's invitation to hamas as " stab in the back "
jerusalem 2-10 ( afp ) - the israeli education minister meir sheetrit said today , friday , that the russian president vladimir putin 's invitation to the hamas leadership to visit moscow was " a stab in the back " to israel .
the minister said in a statement on israeli radio that " this initiative is a stab in the back [ . . . ] because it is aimed at giving international legitimacy to a terrorist group and we have to oppose it with all means . "
the minister went on to say , " what would moscow say if we were to invite chechen representatives to visit jerusalem ? "
sheetrit added , " russia who is preventing free elections in chechnya cannot give us moral lessons on hamas ' legitimacy after the elections . "
for his part , the housing minister zeev boim said in a press statement that " putin is playing with fire " and saw russia 's position as " extremely worrying " .
a high - level israeli official yesterday , thursday , expressed israel 's extreme anger at the recent russian move and said that that " when chechens carry out an attack on moscow , russia regards it as a terrorist act but it 's a different matter when it happens in jerusalem " , in reference to the dozens of suicide attacks carried out by hamas over the past 10 years .
putin announced on thursday in madrid that he would invite hamas officials to moscow " soon " for talks on the future of the peace process between israel and the palestinians .
putin , whose country does not classify hamas as a " terrorist organization " , recently said that the european union had made " a big mistake " when it decided to suspend financial aid to the palestinians .
the russian president emphasized that hamas came to power following democratic elections and that " the choice of the palestinian people has to be respected " .
al-atri government reshuffle and al-shara vice president for foreign affairs
by naseeb aazar
damascus - 2-11 ( afp ) - syrian president bashar al-assad issued three presidential decrees today , saturday , making ministerial changes in which 14 new ministers are to join the government . changes to posts relating to foreign affairs have been especially made to coincide with the foreign pressure campaign that has been exerted on syria over the past year .
according to the first decree , farouq al-shara has been appointed " vice president for foreign and media affairs " .
the second decree concerned a reshuffle in mohammed naji al-atri 's cabinet in which 14 new ministers were brought in to the government in sensitive positions such as the foreign , interior and information ministries , and in which walid al-mualim has been appointed foreign minister after holding the post of deputy to foreign minister farouq al-shara .
the third decree ordered the appointment of the syrian representative to the united nations faisal al-miqdad as a deputy to foreign minister al-mualim .
the government reshuffle did not affect the premiership which remains under the leadership of mohammed naji al-atri while general bassam abdulmajid was appointed interior minister in place of ghazi kanaan who committed suicide on october 12th .
general abdulhameed has been a commander of the military police in syria since 2002 and head of intelligence for southern syria prior to that . he was born in kuneitra in 1950 .
mahdi dakhlallah was removed from the ministry of information and replaced by mohsen bilal , formerly syria 's ambassador to spain for many years and a lecturer at damascus university .
sufian alaw was appointed minister of oil and mineral resources in place of ibrahim haddad and ghiath barakat minister of higher education in place of hani murtadha .
defense minister hassan torkmani kept his post , as did immigration minister buthaina shaban , finance minister mohammed al-hussein and commerce and trade minister amer husni lutfi .
joseph swayid was appointed state minister , the first member of the syrian social national party to be appointed minister since the party joined the national front in 2005 .
the baath party took the lion 's share in government , taking 19 ministries including the premiership with the appointment of seven ministers from seven parties represented by the national progressive front , in addition to seven ministers from the independents .
the national progressive front is a grouping of 10 parties led by the baath party .
it is customary for each of the national progressive front 's nine parties with the exception of the baath party to be represented in government . however , the current ministerial reshuffle has removed the representation of two parties , the arab socialist union led by safwan qudsi and the arab socialist unionist movement led by ghassan abdulaziz othman .
other front parties were represented by six ministers while the communist party took the irrigation ministry with yusuf faisal .
this ministerial reshuffle did not come as a surprise as there has been talk of it since the suicide of interior minister ghazi kanaan which left the post empty after his death on october 12th .
these ministerial changes coincide with the international pressure campaign exerted on syria since the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri . two reports by the international investigation committee implicated the lebanese and syrian security services in the assassination .
the united states also accuses syria of allowing arab fighters into iraq via syrian territory .
yemen 's president reshuffles cabinet following the escape of 23 al-qaida members
by hammoud munsir
sanaa 11-2 ( afp ) - yemen 's president ali abdullah saleh reshuffled his cabinet today , saturday , according to the yemeni news agency saba , following the escape of 23 suspected al-qaida members from a yemeni prison last week .
the yemeni president decided to keep prime minister abdulqadir bajammal as head of government and dismissed defense minister abdullah ali elewa and 15 other ministers .
the yemeni president dismissed the two deputy prime ministers , alawi al-salami and ahmed sufan who held the posts of finance minister and planning minister respectively .
the interior minister rashad al-alimi held his post as well as becoming the sole deputy prime minister .
brigadier general mohammed nasser ahmed ali was appointed defense minister .
the outgoing government was formed in may 2003 after the ruling people 's congress party won the legislative elections .
the ministerial reshuffle comes after criticism of the yemeni government , especially from the united states , following the escape of 23 suspected members of the al-qaida organization from a yemeni intelligence prison in sanaa last saturday .
the escaped prisoners include 13 prisoners sentenced for the bombing of the american destroyer cole and french oil tanker limburg , the most prominent escapee being jamal al-badawi who was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for the bombing of the american destroyer in which 17 american soldiers were killed .
the yemeni authorities launched a campaign to capture the escaped prisoners and arrested around 95 of their relatives in an attempt to force them to give themselves up .
the prisoners escaped through a 44 - meter tunnel running between their prison cells and a nearby mosque . the tunnel was no more than 70 centimeters wide .
warships belonging to the coalition led by the united states which patrol the regional waters off the coast of yemen took part in the search operation for the 23 escaped prisoners while international police interpol launched an international warning about their escape .
yemen is the country from which osama bin laden 's family is descended , the leader of the al-qaida organization who claimed responsibility for the attack .
since the september 11 2001 attacks on the united states , yemen has worked with washington to clamp down on those suspected supporters of the al-qaida organization in yemen .
today , saturday , a yemeni court turned down an appeal by three prisoners who are members of the al-qaida organization , one of whom was among the escaped prisoners who was found guilty of planning attacks on western targets in gulf states .

ten churches burned down in 10 days in the american state of alabama
birmingham ( united states ) 2-13 ( afp ) - ten churches were burned down in 10 days in the state of alabama in the southern united states . police suspect two men without knowing the motives for these acts which were reminiscent of racist acts in the past ..
the most recent criminal act today , saturday , was the burning of the beaverton freewill baptist church 145 km northwest of the town of birmingham .
the authorities quickly announced a link between previous acts of arson and this incident , the tenth of its kind .
there were no victims in these incidents but they did cause massive damage .
the series of incidents began with the burning of five churches in bibb county on february 3rd .
four days later , four more churches in three other neighboring counties to the west of alabama were burned down .
police , who have many leads , are looking for two white persons , in their 20s or 30s with a blue car seen near the churches .
the police announced a reward of 20,000 dollars for assistance in the arrest of the culprits .

in the 1950s and 1960s , many churches frequented by blacks were targeted in the state of alabama .
the wave of churches frequented mainly by blacks being burned down began in 1995 and 1996 when over 30 religious establishments were set fire to in tennessee , louisiana , alabama and south carolina .

baghdad 2-13 ( afp ) - former iraqi president saddam hussein and his seven colleagues caused chaos today , monday , during their 11th trial hearing , insulting and interrupting the judge whom they accused of forcing them to attend court in spite of the absence of their defense counsel .
saddam hussein entered the courtroom wearing a blue robe and black jacket . as he entered , he repeated the words " down with traitors , down with traitors , down with bush , long live the nation , long live the nation , long live the nation . "
the former president told the judge he had been forced to enter the courtroom .
this was followed by a chaotic situation in which the defendants objected to having to attend court by force . barzan ibrahim al-tikriti , saddam hussein 's half - brother , shouted at judge raouf rasheed abdulrahman , " you have no mercy and your name in no way describes you . you are neither a praiseworthy mahmoud nor a compassionate raouf . you are a military ruler and not a judge . we do not want to sit in this place . "
he added , " i ca n't continue with this session without my lawyer . "
he went on to say that he was suffering from " an incurable disease and i 've had medical tests by the americans at the american military base . you have to let me go so that i can have treatment because the law states that a defendant with an incurable disease must be released . i am dying slowly , you are killing me . "
when the judge informed him that the court had agreed to his being examined by a medical panel , he said , " if you fear god , release me so that i can have treatment with my family to support me . i will sign any undertaking to pledge that i will attend the hearings . i have honor and want to defend my honor . "
he went on to say , " but if you think the baath party needs me , i want to tell you that the baath party is working perfectly well and does n't need me or anyone else and its secretary - general ( pointing to saddam hussein ) has been in prison for two years so release me so i can have treatment . "
the judge replied , " you have talked a lot and used up a lot of the court 's time . " barzan interrupted him saying " i have the right to talk until tomorrow . "
after that , barzan al-tikriti noticed that the judge was ignoring his pleas for release . he got up from his chair and sat on the floor , turning his back on the judge and ignoring the court hearing .
ٍsaddam , who appeared to be angry and carried a koran in his hands , swore at the judge for forcing him to attend the hearing . he said , " this is the practice of agents , god is great and may the despicable be driven away , god curse your mustache . "
he added , " this is not a court , this is a game . "
saddam told the judge , " you have no right to appoint lawyers for us instead of our lawyers , with all due respect to them because they agreed to defend us , and with respect to every iraqi . "
the judge stated that " the court appointed lawyers to replace the defense team in accordance with iraqi law after the defense layers boycotted the hearings . " saddam answered him saying " they did not boycott the hearings , it is you who threw them out and some of them were beaten up in front of you . "
judge abdulrahman replied , " i will not allow you to talk about political matters . "
saddam interrupted him saying " you are ignorant . what politics ? you are working in a biased way and in breach of the law . "
he then heard the testimonies of various witnesses who talked about what they endured at the hands of the security services after being arrested in 1982 .
saddam hussein made an objection . he said to the presiding judge , " when witnesses talk about politics , this is allowed , but when saddam hussein and his colleagues talk about political matters , this is prohibited . "
saddam hussein , his former aides and the defense counsel boycotted the court 's 10th hearing and withdrew from the previous hearing following an altercation with the new judge who took over presidency of the special court , raouf rasheed abdulrahman .
lawyer khalil al-dulaimi , head of saddam hussein 's defense team , had told france presse news agency in a telephone call on sunday that " in my capacity as head of the defense team , i can confirm that none of the defense team nor the defendants will attend today 's court hearing . "
jafar al-mosawi , the court 's public prosecutor , stated that " the court will hold a meeting prior to the court hearing to look into the possibility of forcibly making the defendants appear or leaving them be if they insist on not attending . "
he considered that " if the court reaches a decision , then this has to be implemented regardless of what that decision is . "
saddam hussein and his aides have been on trial since last october for the killing of 148 people in the shiite village of dujail in retaliation against an attack on the former iraqi president 's escort during his visit to the village in 1982 .

jeddah ( saudi arabia ) 2-13 ( afp ) - the european union 's high representative for foreign policy , javier solana , carried a message of " respect " to the muslim world while the secretary - general of the organization of the islamic conference ekmeleddin ihsanoglu called on the europeans to adopt legislation to combat " anti - islamism " .
the meeting between the two men took place at the headquarters of the organization of the islamic conference in jeddah on the red sea amidst the crisis arising from the publication of cartoons of the prophet mohammed , which many consider offensive to muslims , in european newspapers .
solana said after the meeting , " with regard to the european union , we have profound respect for muslims [ . . . ] we would never want to hurt their feelings " and said that " this was never our intention and will never be our intention . "
he said that he had informed ihsanoglu of this message by telephone but that he also wanted to deliver it personally .
for his part , ihsanoglu stressed the need for europeans to adopt legislation through the european parliament to combat anti - islamism .
oglu said , " unfortunately , what is happening now [ . . . ] is that since 9/11 , the muslim world has started to feel a new upsurge against it " in reference to the attacks against the united states in 2001 .
ihsanoglu called for basic principles to be outlined requiring respect of all religions and a ban on slander in a foundation statement by the new human rights council that it is currently being created .
solana avoided directly answering the issue of legislation of this sort . however , he said that he saw " no problem in approving a clause to this effect if this comes within the framework of the human rights council that is currently being created . "
this council will replace the current commission which has its headquarters in geneva . it lost a great deal of respect and credibility when it became apparent that its working procedures allow countries that do not respect human rights to be among its ranks .
solana had announced on wednesday that he would visit " several countries " in the region , including saudi arabia , to assuage anger in the muslim world following the publication of these cartoons .
according to the visit schedule , solana will head for riyadh after this meeting where he will meet the saudi foreign minister , prince saud al-faisal and king abdullah bin abdulaziz .
after saudi arabia , solana will head for egypt to meet president hosni mubarak and the secretary - general of the arab league amr moussa , then jordan and will end his trip in the palestinian territories and israel .
the secretary - general of the arab league amr moussa , in a speech to the jeddah economic forum on sunday , called for the " evil spark " caused by the publication of the offensive cartoons of the prophet mohammed to be extinguished and rejected a return to the crusades .
moussa said , " it is not appropriate to have a conflict between east and west in this age . let us muslims , we who care about good relations , shake hands with our brothers in europe and america who share our view , and they are many , and we will extinguish this evil spark . "
he added , " let us put this matter behind us and work together , we and them , to prevent this happening again . "
the offensive drawings of the prophet mohammed were first published in a danish newspaper in september before being published in several other european newspapers in the name of freedom of expression .
the region saw danish goods being boycotted and violent protests in the arab and muslim world which resulted in many people being killed and wounded .
saudi arabia , libya and syria recalled their ambassadors from denmark .
denmark pulled out its ambassadors from syria , iran and indonesia , fearing for their safety .

mofaz accuses hizbollah of attempting to ignite israel 's northern front
cairo 2-14 ( afp ) - israeli defense minister shaul mofaz accused the shiite lebanese party hizbollah of attempting to ignite israel 's northern front with the " support of syria and iran . "
mofaz told journalists at the end of a meeting with egyptian president hosni mubarak in cairo that " hizbollah is using lebanese territory as a base for its terrorist activities against israel . "
he added , " we know that syria and iran are supporting hizbollah and their aim is to deflect the international community 's attention away from syria to the lebanese - israeli border . "
he said syria was under american and western pressure because " it supports and funds terrorism . "
he said that he had informed mubarak of the recent operation carried out by hizbollah along the border and that " they try to kidnap israeli soldiers " .
the israeli minister said that " hizbollah 's aim , backed by syria and iran , is to open a second front against israel . "
hizbollah carried out an attack on february 3rd in the disputed shaba farms area on the border between lebanon , syria and israel after a lebanese shepherd was shot by the israelis . the israeli army retaliated and this led to an escalation of tensions along the border .
iran confirms that it has resumed its uranium enrichment operations ( summary )
by siyavush ghazi
tehran 2-14 ( afp ) - today , tuesday , tehran confirmed that it has resumed its uranium enrichment operations at the natnaz plant and refused to put on hold its " research " in this area while western countries have stipulated that this process must stop before negotiations with tehran can be resumed on the issue of tehran 's nuclear program .
javad waidi , member of the supreme council for national security and in charge of the nuclear dossier , announced that " work has started " at the uranium enrichment plant in natnaz ( center ) .
on monday , tehran announced the removal of the seals and monitoring cameras belonging to the international atomic energy commission from the natnaz plant .
diplomatic sources in vienna , the headquarters of the international atomic energy commission , announced that iran had resumed the enrichment program at that plant .
however , waidi declined to comment on statements saying that the iranians had begun enrichment work by adding uranium hexafluoride gas into the centrifuge system .
he told journalists , after a speech to a tehran muslim students ' association , " i cannot give you an answer about these technical matters . "
resumption of the enrichment process itself led to talks with the europeans being cut off last august , then in january after they were resumed in december .
these countries took a decision on 4th february at the international atomic energy commission to ask iran to suspend all sensitive activities and informed the security council of the iranian dossier .
however , instead of complying , tehran responded by announcing the end of reinforced monitoring of its nuclear program set up by the international atomic energy commission and the resumption of all activities , especially those connected with enrichment on a large scale .
the natnaz plant includes two enrichment units , one of which focuses on research while the second is an industrial - scale installation under construction .
with regard to this unit , waidi said that iran " needs time to complete its industrial capacity with about 60,000 centrifuges ( to enrich uranium ) but we have started our activities " . he said that his country saw " no reason at the present time to make further comments " about its activities at this site .
waidi justified the series of unilateral initiatives by his country saying that " the europeans , after starting with good intentions over the past three years , are now asking us to completely abandon the nuclear power series " .
the europeans reject iran enriching uranium on its territory because they regard this country as not having proved that its nuclear program is for civilian purposes .
the enrichment process is fundamental to obtaining nuclear power but can also be used to make nuclear weapons .
the international atomic energy commission is expected to hold another meeting on march 6th to look into whether iran has complied with its requirements and will probably decide to refer the file to the security council .
in the meantime , an iranian delegation is visiting moscow on february 20th according to waidi to examine a russian proposal to enrich iranian uranium on its territory .
however , this proposal is dependent on the position of the iranians who are carrying out the enrichment process on their territory which is what western countries object to .

he went on to say that the president of a muslim country adopting a nazi anti - semitic stance was " a disgrace to muslims the world over . "
the islam - archiv - deutschland institute , founded in 1927 , is the oldest muslim society in germany .
it aims to protect the archives of the muslim community since the 18th century and promotes dialogue between germany 's muslims and other religious groups .
palestinian liberation organization : expansion of settlements wrecks opportunities to achieve peace in the region
by nasser abu bakr
ramallah ( west bank ) 15-2 ( afp ) - the executive committee of the palestinian liberation organization today , wednesday , regarded the expansion of israeli settlements as wrecking opportunities to achieve peace in the region and reiterated its full commitment to all agreements signed with the israeli government under international patronage .
a statement by the executive committee at the close of a meeting today at the headquarters in ramallah , presided over by the palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas , a copy of which was sent to agency france press , said that " the executive committee is reflecting on the attack targeted at the al-aghwar area in an israeli attempt to isolate this area from the rest of the palestinian territories on the west bank under blatant security and expansionist pretexts . "
it stated its " outright rejection of these settlement plans which are tearing up our palestinian land into isolated cantons to stop our people from establishing an independent state . "
the statement went on to say that " the executive committee has turned to the quadripartite committee that created the road map to inform it of our position on this creeping settlement on our land and the need for it to play its role in the peace process and the two - state ( establishment ) solution . "
it went on to say that " the continued settlement of holy jerusalem , the racist separation wall and isolation of the al-aghwar area in an attempt to make it jewish , as well as the crimes of assassination , violations and detentions only wreck any chance of establishing a just and permanent peace in the middle east . "
it added , " it has been decided to hold a meeting of the supreme council under saleem al-zanoun ( abu al-adib ) , president of ramallah 's national council , this week to discuss current preparations for convening the central palestinian council and to approve plans and decisions prepared by the supreme council to activate the organization , the executive committee and specific departments . "
the statement said the committee " discussed the forthcoming meeting of the palestinian legislative council to be held on saturday " and declared a " total commitment to all national principles approved by successive palestinian national councils , as well as commitment to the palestinian liberation organization 's political program and the 1988 declaration of independence . "
it confirmed " its total commitment to all political agreements signed with the government of israel under international patronage as well as abiding by international legal resolutions relating to the palestinian issue , especially resolution 194 concerning the right of return of palestinian refugees and the decisions of the arab summit in beirut . "
the statement said that " all palestinian bodies must play their political and national roles , at the forefront of which are the legislative and executive bodies , in order to ensure our national interests and international recognition of the organization , the authority and the higher interests of our people . "
salih rafaat , member of the palestinian liberation organization 's executive committee , told the france presse news agency in a statement that " the committee has decided to start a wide scale diplomatic campaign on the arab and international front , including the security council , the quadripartite committee and signatory countries of the geneva conventions , in order to challenge the israeli policy aimed at concealing settlements in the al-aghwar area and unilaterally drawing up the border . "
he added , " the executive committee confirms that members of the legislative council are members of the national council . with this , the hamas movement enters the palestinian national council which is considered to be the palestinian liberation organization 's parliament and this also qualifies it to join all the organization 's institutions which the hamas movement was previously cautious about joining . "
he went on to say , " the executive committee has discussed president abbas ' speech which he is to make at the legislative council 's inauguration ceremony next saturday . "
rafaat said that the speech " will declare commitment to the liberation organization 's political line and will say that any president of the palestinian government must abide by palestinian , arab and international law . "
rice admits mistakes made by american administration in rebuilding iraq
washington 16-2 ( afp ) - american secretary of state condoleezza rice was forced to admit at a congress hearing today , thursday , several mistakes made by the american administration in rebuilding iraq .
after kent conrad , democrat senator for north dakota , rained down questions on her about the results of rebuilding programs which the united states has spent in excess of 20 billion dollars on , rice was forced to admit two mistakes made by the american administration , one relating to the training of iraqi forces and the other to infrastructure .
the secretary of state , who was giving evidence to the senate 's budget committee , said that the iraqi security forces were now up to 227,000 men .
she said , " to be honest , we made a mistake in the beginning because we depended on quantity and not on quality . the people we have now are competent . "
when she spoke about the united states " developing a considerable part of the infrastructure " , especially with regard to drinking water and water purification , rice admitted under pressure after being questioned by the senator that the number of iraqis supplied with drinking water and waste disposal means was less than before the war .
she added , " you 're right , we 've focused our efforts on strengthening resources to secure these services " and not on local water supply and purification systems .
conrad answered her saying " we can improve these resources and that 's good but what people care about in the end is having these services . "
strange laws give england a hilarious side
by jalal malti
london 2-17 ( afp ) - england has a set of old laws and traditions , some of which are strange and some of which are funny , that are still in force even if they are not applied but in any case , law students find them hilarious .
one of these laws is a law dating back to 1279 which stipulates that " members of parliament are not permitted to wear armor " inside parliament . this law was aimed at preventing feuds and fights ending in death between lords in a country with deep democratic roots .
another strange law prohibits members of parliament from dying in westminster palace and should this happen , then the corpse had to be carried outside parliament before a death certificate can be issued .
nigel cawthorne , editor of a book called strange laws of old england which reviews these amazing regulations forgotten by time , says that the reasoning behind this law is that westminster palace is a royal palace and everyone who dies in a palace has the right to a formal funeral . "
members of parliament are also allowed to gamble and drink alcohol freely in westminster including inside the library while citizens would incur a fine for such behavior according to the library breaches law ( 1898 ) .
in england , there are over 4000 national laws , 11,000 bylaws and 13,000 special laws passed before 1801 and which are still in force .
cawthorne told agency france press news agency that " the legal tradition is very important " in england , saying that " things change but very slowly and ( laws ) come one after another . "
the fact is that members of parliament legislated many aspects of daily life , some of them very ordinary and in the 19th century , at the height of the industrial revolution , they issued a number of laws aimed at organizing life in the suburbs .
this attention to detail led for example to the prohibition of washing being hung out in the street , firing a gun without a reason , lighting a fire in the garden , flying kites , ice - skating , disturbing residents by knocking on their door without a reason , lighting street lights " intentionally and illegally " and other laws that are now regarded as hilarious .
some of these laws have not been implemented for a long time because of the progress made since they were issued , the funniest of which is not being allowed to ride a horse , cow or steam car in an inebriated state ( 1872 ) .
a law dating back to 1867 also prohibits anyone " living less than a mile from an ammunition or explosives depot " from owning a pack of cards while a law issued in 1839 stipulates that anyone firing a canon near a house should be punished .
kevin martin , president of the law society responsible for suggesting laws that ought to be annulled , says that " these unusual examples give us an idea about the tradition of law in this country and also prove the need to renew the law and adapt to reality . "
more than 2000 laws have been annulled since 1965 in a massive operation to update laws .
however , british members of parliament insist on continuing to issue strange laws such as the " outer space law " ( 1986 ) which prohibits any british citizen from " throwing a body into space " without official permission and defines space as including the " moon and the majority of celestial bodies . "
they also deemed it wise to give judges the power to issue orders " to use a reasonable amount of force " in hitting back against a possible invasion by aliens .
sunni imam warns against celebrating valentine 's day
baghdad 2-17 ( afp ) - three days after valentine 's day , a sunni imam launched an attack , during his friday sermon , on valentine 's day and those celebrating it in iraq , saying that it " diverts young people from virtue to sin . "
most imams in iraqi mosques focused their friday sermons on images of prisoner abuse dating back to 2004 while others focused on poor services and the difficult security situation in the country , however sheikh mahmoud al-sumeidi , imam of the umm al-qura mosque , focused on valentine 's day which is celebrated throughout the world on the 14th of this month and saw it as bearing no relation to islam .
he said , " international valentine 's day happened two or three days ago , and unfortunately many of our young men and women on this day do what our enemies like , and exchanged gifts and words , even to the point of kissing . this is how our enemies want us to live , far removed from virtue . "
valentine 's day is a very popular day in iraq , just as it is in other countries in the world , in which young people give their girlfriends chocolates , flowers , perfumes and other gifts .
al-sumeidi added , " every invasion has an aim and the invasion of our country targets our young people and wants to divert them from virtue to sin . "
the celebration of this occasion in iraq goes back to before the american invasion in 2003 . a big celebration was held on this occasion during the era of ousted president saddam hussein 's regime and state television would show programs dedicated to the occasion .
the iraqi president 's son , uday , was known to hold big parties on valentine 's day , in the hunting club in the sophisticated mansour area , which used to go on until the early hours of the morning .
al-sumeidi said that " nothing is said in islam about valentine 's day and muslims must live by their religion . "
berlusconi signs political agreement with far right in italy
rome 2-17 ( afp ) - italian prime minister silvio berlusconi today , friday , signed a political agreement seven weeks prior to the legislative elections with the neo - fascist social alternative movement led by alessandra mussolini , granddaughter of italian dictator benito mussolini .
berlusconi said in the presence of mussolini , " we have reached an agreement on the agenda between the house of liberties ( ruling alliance ) and social alternative " , broadening his election alliance to include the far right .
the alliance with social alternative in preparation for the elections on april 19th angered the rest of berlusconi 's alliance because of the inclusion of controversial figures allied with the far - right neo - fascist movement .
berlusconi said that " our family photo album is perfect , it 's pure white . "
a solution was reached when mussolini and her two irritating allies roberto fiore , leader of forza nuova ( new force ) , and adriano tilgher , leader of the national social front , decided not to personally stand as candidates on the alliance list and nominated other candidates .
massimo d'alema , leader of the democratic left ( biggest opposition party ) said today that " it is a very dangerous matter indeed , to have berlusconi sign agreements with the neo - fascist far right . "
ignazio la russa , leader of the national alliance ( conservative right wing party which sprung out of the fascist movement ) , the second party in berlusconi 's alliance , said that in spite of the social alternative leaders withdrawing their candidacy , " the basic problem remains which is a split in basic values and the political agenda . "
mussolini 's party is calling for the rejection of turkey joining the european union , the european detention brief and abortion laws . it wants the deportation of immigrants and the signing of a new agreement with the catholic church , and condemns " american imperialism . "
muslims biggest victims of terrorism committed in the name of islam ( belgian study )
brussels 2-17 ( afp ) - a new study by belgian researchers called " the growth of terrorism in 2005 " reports that muslims are the biggest victims of terrorism committed in the name of islam and that international terrorism strikes the middle east more often than the west .
on the other hand , the study showed that 90% of victims of terrorism in 2005 were killed in iraq and jordan .
this study was led by rick kolsat , lecturer in international relations at ghent university in west belgium and was published on the government 's " economy " internet site .
according to the study , the number of international terrorist acts fell considerably in 2005 compared to 2004 , in which 266 attacks killed 443 people in 2004 versus 393 attacks killing 733 people in 2005 .
the study regarded terrorism as not being a widespread danger since it is essentially concentrated in one region , the middle east .
on the other hand , " local " terrorism perpetrated by the citizens of a country against targets in their own country increased considerably between 2004 and 2005 with the number of attacks rising by 90% and a 60% increase in the number of victims .
the study attributed this increase almost entirely to the situation in iraq .
it also said that " the conflict in iraq , presented as being a factor in the war on terrorism , contributed to making iraq the current center for terrorism . "
citing these figures , rick kolsat said in a telephone conversation , " imagine how the muslim world views these figures when the west insists that it is the one threatened by terrorism ? "
the study revealed that " the concept that suggests that international terrorism is basically an external threat is not supported by fact . "
on the same note , kolsat said that " jihad - based terrorism is not the existential danger we perceive it to be , although it is a challenge to our societies . "
this study , the second of its kind , was based on data obtained form the renowned american institution rand corporation , from the national memorial for the prevention of terrorism and its databank on terrorism .
berlusconi faces difficulty in sacking minister accused of insulting islam
by christian spielmann
rome 2-18 ( afp ) - italian prime minister silvio berlusconi battled with his allies in the northern league today , saturday , to be allowed to sack one of his top men , reform minister roberto calderoli , in order to ease tensions caused by his offensive statements about islam in the muslim world .
the prime minister asked calderoli to resign but stressed on the same day , saturday , that he had " no authority to force him " to do so .
the minister in question responded by saying that he was prepared to resign " if umberto bossi ( leader of the northern league ) asks me to do so and if the muslim world makes a conciliatory gesture . "
the italian minister is accused of insulting islam by wearing a t - shirt with the offensive cartoons of the prophet mohammed which led to a dangerous international crisis . he wore the t - shirt on thursday and appeared in it on the evening news on italy 's channel " rai uno " .
this action and further accusations against islam he made in press statements on friday led to violent anti - italian demonstrations in libya in which 10 people were killed on friday .
roberto calderoli does not intend to apologize . the newspaper corriere della sera reported today , saturday , that he said " i do n't feel responsible for those deaths . "
he stressed in a statement to the newspaper la repubblica that " western civilization is under threat . "
silvio berlusconi caused shock waves in the muslim world when he stated that " western civilization is superior " . this was on september 26 , 2001 , two weeks after the attacks in the united states . he faced a great deal of difficulty in making amends for these statements .
calderoli ( 49 years old ) , a former specialist maxillofacial surgeon , is seen as an extremely conservative member of the northern league , a movement that is against foreigners and allied to berlusconi .
he came into the government in july 2004 to replace bossi , the leader of the league , who was forced to resign after a heart attack . the league runs three ministries : the justice , labor and reform ministries .
roberto calderoli says he enjoys the support of umberto bossi and his party , as well as " the support of many who think like me . "
he bragged to la repubblica newspaper , " silvio berlusconi has asked for my resignation but i have n't resigned yet . "
the italian authorities fear more anti - italian demonstrations today , saturday , in the muslim world in addition to repercussions in italy .
berlusconi announced that he had asked interior minister giuseppe pisano to provide security for the northern league 's offices and said that " protective measures have been taken to ensure the safety of italian missions abroad . "
italy 's foreign minister , gianfranco fini , announced his intention to visit a mosque in rome today , saturday , in an effort to ease the tension caused by calderoli 's statements .
this is not the first time the prime minister has clashed with the northern league in asking for the resignation of one of its ministers from government .
in july 2003 , he was forced to negotiate with umberto bossi on the matter of the resignation of tourism minister stefano stefani who made offensive statements about german tourists .
the confrontation lasted a week and caused a crisis in diplomatic relations with germany which were in trouble anyway because of insults silvio berlusconi made personally about a german deputy whom he compared to a nazi prison guard .
this new crisis comes at a sensitive phase for the prime minister who is submerged in a difficult campaign for the legislative elections to be held on april 19 . maurizio gaspari , a national alliance leader ( right ) , said that the crisis " has come at a time when our position in opinion polls has started to improve .

solana caught between his heart and mind . by nureddine ashour
the current trip by the european union 's foreign policy coordinator javier solana does not bring up the question of the possibility of it succeeding as much as it begs the question of whether he turned to his mind or his heart when he volunteered to try and calm muslim public opinion following the publication of offensive cartoons of the prophet in a number of european newspapers .
as solana is currently in the middle east , it seems that he has turned to his heart after feeling offended by the publication of the cartoons and he feels what muslims feel towards the insult directed at them in the name of freedom of expression because he did not hesitate in stating that " the european union has a profound respect for muslims ...
and did not want to hurt their feelings . "
this is part of what the european official said after his recent meeting with the secretary - general of the organization of the islamic conference .
had the european foreign policy coordinator preferred to follow ( and this is just an assumption ) his mind , he would not have bothered himself with going to the middle east , whether to apologize or " convince " and the crisis would have been resolved in a european context since denmark is a member of the european union and its economic interests risk being damaged ...
is it logical that one side should rush to the oppressed to calm and soothe him before condemning the oppressor and making him understand that what has been done is unacceptable ?
was hitler left free and unfettered during world war ii to implement his aggressive plans and racist ideas , with the allies limiting themselves to commiserating with the europeans , including the jews ?
what is most dangerous in the matter is that there are efforts to convince muslims of the sincerity of the european attitude which has still not negated the pretext of freedom of expression in the debate on the publication of the cartoons , yet this does not resolve the crisis and some have paid with their lives for protesting against the cartoons . in the end , europe has succeeded in achieving two things , the first of which is to soften the situation and keep it within the framework of freedom of publication and the other is to have exported the crisis to muslim countries for it to be reduced to chaos and violence .
this is why the mere fact of solana being transformed into the one who is making conciliatory gestures to the muslim world tells us that the european union has not fully understood the feelings of muslims who do not deny the right to expression but do not want it to be a means of inciting hatred and violating religious sensibilities .
when we hear of a european law being issued which criminalizes attacks on religion and sacred beliefs , then solana 's efforts will be truly welcome .
lakhdhar brahimi and iraq 's mandela . by asiya latrousse
given that acknowledging failure and admitting defeat have never found their way into the dictionary of international diplomacy in general or arab diplomacy in particular , especially when it is related to the war on iraq , or the incidents , accompanying circumstances and secrets that have surrounded and surrounds it , which may not be revealed for a long time , what lakhdar brahimi , the experienced algerian diplomat has said about his impossible task in iraq cannot pass by without attracting interest or inviting reflection .
and because lakhdar brahimi is also practically the only arab and north african diplomat who has agreed to engage in the adventure from close up and took on a mission that was not free from danger , either personally or career - wise , by going to an arab country after its invasion and destruction . so it is perfectly natural , in view of the dangerous developments in the iraqi arena over the past two and a half years , that his mission should give rise to a great deal of controversy about the reasons and motives that might push a man of brahimi 's importance and experience to agree to take on a role under the american occupation administration when he had taken a clear stand from the start and did not hesitate to admit that the decision to go to war was made outside the framework of international law . lakhdar brahimi had previously linked the success of his mission in south africa during the apartheid era with the presence of a leader such as mandela who was able to set up the truth and reconciliation commission and unite his people around him to achieve a dream that had seemed almost impossible a few years earlier ...
no doubt that when brahimi , the former advisor to the united nations secretary - general , whose career in various areas of diplomacy and efforts in many crises in developing countries cannot be underestimated , comes back and admits the failure of his mission and sets out the reasons and types of mistakes made away from the rigidity and mortal arrogance , then he will have taken off the cloak of the obstinate and unyielding diplomat who knows he is mistaken but refuses to admit it and insists on continuing along an erroneous path because pride and haughtiness prevent him from doing so in spite of his awareness of the possible repercussions and dangers of this ...
.
in an interview with an arab newspaper , brahimi admitted his failure in his mission in iraq which he described as impossible given the many vetoes he faced while carrying out his mission . brahimi , who had and still has a reputation for difficult missions , does not deny his feelings of discomfort at having accepted to work for the occupier in iraq and in such difficult circumstances . he considers that what drove him to accept this mission at that time was the american administration 's promise that it intended to end the occupation as quickly as possible , something that is not true now that it has become apparent that what the american administration cares about is not so much about finding a solution to the current situation as it is about finding a solution to the problem it has created for itself in iraq , especially in the face of american public opinion which knows that the reasons given by the white house administration to justify the war were fictitious and based on false reports .
perhaps the reasons that drove brahimi to acknowledge failure are not limited to only one reason but to a series of reasons , the most significant of which is his realization that invasion anywhere will bring resistance and resistance brings oppression , torture , imprisonment , secret prisons and that in any case , the military option cannot be the required solution in iraq ...
brahimi 's admission reflects a reality that has existed in iraq for many months , not in terms of the size of material losses and destruction but more importantly in terms of the size of human losses , psychological wounds , loss and displacement in the absence of an effective national figure capable of bringing the iraqis together and uniting them , an extremely important matter in the current situation and in overcoming the obstacles at the next stage ...
so is it possible that after all the suffering the iraqis have endured to re - examine the incorrect strategy in iraq to salvage what can be salvaged and to give the iraqis a chance to regain their sovereignty , away from recommendations and solutions imported in cans of democracy ?
news analysis : after hamas ' victory and its alliance with damascus , tehran and moscow : will washington back down from its political projects in the arab world ?
by kamal bin yunus
tunisia - al-sabah - pressure on the american administration has increased , after hamas won the palestinian parliamentary elections , to persuade it to give up its projects aimed at political and economic reform in the greater middle east - i.e. in the arab islamic world from morocco to indonesia - so that the " radical current " made up of enemies of washington and the west does not benefit from these elections ...
especially as all american and european opinion polls
suggest the likelihood of increased feelings of opposition to the policies of the united states and atlantic capitals within arab and muslim public opinion because of the afghanistan and iraq wars and the american administration and the majority of western governments aligning themselves with sharon 's government throughout the campaign to suppress the palestinian nation and its leaders over the past five years ...
according to the british newspaper the financial times , president george bush 's administration " is currently reviewing its stated plans to spread democracy in the middle east region after the overwhelming victory of the hamas islamic movement in the recent palestinian legislative elections . "
the newspaper reported that neo - conservatives close to the american president have started to back down from plans to spread democracy in the middle east after the overwhelming victory by the hamas movement .
it added that since the results of these elections were announced , " a flurry of reports and studies have been pouring in to the bush administration advising it to take its time and slow down on the issue of spreading democracy in the middle east . "
ending the pressure on regimes
many recommendations have been made by conservative research centers and think - tanks which support the republican administration in the white house calling on it " not to put pressure on arab regimes " and to stop backing " the tendency to impose the model of democratization in eastern europe on countries in the muslim world . "
opponents of democratization in the muslim arab world link the hamas victory to the election gains made by the fundamentalist movement in the iranian elections and to muslim brotherhood candidates winning five seats in parliament for the first time in egypt .
security and military alliance
according to the financial times and many european and american sources , " in spite of the criticisms made by the administration of the egyptian regime because of its legal violations during the last legislative elections " , the american budget for 2007 expects to see an increase in the amount of military and security aid to cairo since it sees it as " an ally in the war on terror . " ...
in other words , washington and its european allies ' priority will be security rather than politics .
hamas ' alliance with washington 's enemies
this debate , which will continue in the european and american media , will be heightened by several issues including :
* the backing of certain countries , which washington and some european capitals regard as major enemies , for the hamas movement ( and its forthcoming government ) , particularly syria , iran , sudan , russia and venezuela , with the list possibly increasing to include other countries such as cuba , korea , china and several arab and muslim countries .
* the objective alliance between tehran , moscow , beijing and many european and asian countries against sanctions on iran because of the iranian nuclear portfolio ,
and tehran 's foreign policy after ahmadinejad 's victory and the weakening of the moderate reformist movement led by mohammed khatami and former culture minister mahajrani .
* the failure of most of washington 's liberal and secular allies in the iraqi elections .
the battle in the elections , the political game and the iraqi security conflicts is played out between sunni , shiite and kurdish movements , parties and groups with many contradiction between them but the overwhelming majority of them have religious overtones ...
and do not distinguish between religion and politics .
* continued security concerns and the series of suicide attacks against american and coalition forces in iraq and afghanistan ( thousands of americans dead and wounded in 2005 alone ) and against israeli targets in occupied palestine ...
in spite of the pro - reform and democracy projects adopted by president bush 's administration over the years .
this means that these projects have not as yet helped to improve the image the general public and radical movements in the " greater middle east " have of washington and its policies in the region .
resolutions from the georgia and istanbul summits
it may be premature to expect washington to back down from its big project - also adopted by the group of eight at the georgia summit and the atlantic alliance summit in istanbul in 2004 - which aims at re - enacting the eastern european picture in the arab islamic world .
however , there are several indicators that reveal the hesitation of many american and european decision - makers in continuing to support the " democratic reform " project
if such a democracy leads to the appearance of forces opposed to the strategic interests of washington and its allies in the region
and in the world ,
starting with israel 's interests .
if this hesitation continues , the priority of washington and its allies will again be security and military priorities and not political ones ...
in spite of the public statements made repeatedly by president bush junior and his former secretary of state colin powell and current secretary of state rice which deem one of the reasons for the appearance of anti - american and western terrorist movements to be its 60 year long support for the security option at the price of freedom and democracy .
on controlling energy and encouraging new energy : electricity production by means of nuclear power is one of the most important energy solutions in the medium and long term and studies on possible solutions to combating outside attacks on electricity and gas networks
tunisia - al-sabah - othman bin irfa , director - general of the tunisian electricity and gas company , said that in the medium and long term , in other words over the next 20 years , our country needs to generate and produce electricity by investing in nuclear power which is regarded as the best cheap alternative energy solution
at present as the cost of fuel continues to rise in the world .
steg 's chief executive said on the occasion of his presentation of the company 's strategy to guarantee the country 's energy needs to the parliamentary economic and financial committee , in the presence of representatives from the national energy control agency yesterday evening at its headquarters in the capital , that there would soon be a high - level study of possible solutions to combat the problem of repeated outside attacks on the company 's electricity and gas network causing annual losses of millions of dinars and representing the cause of 50% of electricity failures in greater tunis .
othman bin irfa , in this meeting attended by izzedine khalafallah , chief executive of the national energy agency , highlighted steg 's future programs in the field of energy production in addition to tackling many issues related to services offered to professionals .
in his speech on future possibilities in the area of alternative energy , he said that in addition to using solar and wind power , nuclear power is regarded as the most important alternative energy source that can be exploited to produce electricity , especially as the tunisian electricity network has the capacity to contain and supply the massive electrical power produced by nuclear energy .
in this regard , he explained that tunisia had presented an application for the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes to the head of the international atomic energy agency during a previous visit to our country .
the presentation of the company 's future programs revealed that in 2005 steg produced 156600 oil equivalent tons , equivalent to 29 million dinars .
the forthcoming phase will see work on supplying new areas with natural gas and connecting 50,000 new clients to the network as part of a program running from 2005 to 2009 to bring the number of clients to over 400,000 which will reduce state funding by around 92 million dinars .
the company will also work in the future to reduce the provision of bottled gas by expanding the qabis gas production and transfer plant to achieve an annual profit of about 15 million dinars , as well as improving quality and billing services using the latest technology and monthly debit payments which 70,000 clients have so far subscribed to or using pre - paid vouchers which may become more widely used in the future .
1.25 oil equivalent tons saved
the presentation by the chief executive of the national energy control agency highlighted the essence of the three - part program to control energy in 2005-2009 which will result in total savings of around 1.25 million oil equivalent tons and reduce state funding by 220 million dinars for credits estimated at 70 million dinars .
with regard to solar - powered hot water , 22,000m2 were processed and five suppliers and 237 companies were certified in 2005 which will lead to savings of about 1600 oil equivalent tons a year and reduce state funding by around 516 million dinars a year .
84 natural gas companies were also contracted which will make it possible to replace around 100,000 oil equivalent tons a year of supported petroleum products and reduce state funding by around 7.6 million dinars a year .
220,000 residents are also scheduled to be connected to the natural gas network and the use of energy - saving equipment will be made generally accessible by using around 8,000 pressure units in the old lighting networks , leading to an energy saving of 30% of the annual consumption cost of local councils , equivalent to 7 million dinars a year .
the energy control program will be extended to all domestic electrical appliances , starting with fridges where less energy efficient brands will be gradually be phased out , through category 8 then 7 then 6 and 5.
with regard to wind power , 160 megawatts will be processed by steg by expanding the sidi daoud wind station as a first step .
in terms of scientific research , 8 research projects have been developed in the area of energy control involving 20 laboratories , 12 institutions and 200 researchers at various scientific research centers .
energy - saving lamp month
the same program will process 3 million energy - saving lamps between 2005 and 2008 which will lead to an energy saving of 136,000 oil equivalent tons and reduce funding by 12 million dinars . to date , an international call for tenders has been put out for 2 million lamps with the possibility of supplying the market through local production of around 400,000 lamps a month at a cost of no more than 4500 millimes per lamp .
concerning developments in terms of awareness and sensitization , energy - saving lamp month was launched from 10 to march 10th in the form of a multi - media advertising campaign to promote locally - made energy saving lamps sold at a fixed price of 2860 millimes to 4445 millimes , depending in the brand , in all major outlets . it is expected that the campaign will supply 400,000 lamps .
television , radio , press and on the ground campaigns will continue to run this year alongside 6 sector seminars in cooperation with the ministries concerned .
the meeting was punctuated by detailed discussions between committee members and steg and national energy control agency officials . this was an opportunity for deputies to pose questions and make suggestions and many of them showed their surprise at what was presented by the two bodies in terms of important features of future programs in the area of energy control .
steg 's development on all levels has brought it national and international acclaim .
in this context too , it should be noted that 43 steg branches throughout the republic will soon be receiving international quality certification .

food trade budget this year : towards achieving a 197 million dinar excess
tunisia - al-sabah - preliminary forecasts for the food trade budget for the current year suggest that exports will grow by 15.6% to 1187 million dinars versus 1027 million dinars in 2005 according to the 2006 agriculture and fisheries trade budget to achieve an excess of 197 million dinars , making the volume of exports greater than that of imports .
this improvement is based on an expected growth in olive oil exports which is predicted to be around 600 million dinars this year compared to 476 million dinars last year , an increase of 26% .
as for other products , returns are expected to grow by 13% compared to last year for crab , with the french market making up most exports at a percentage of 99.8% .
in this context , 241 tons of crab were exported for the first time last year .
this is in addition to positive growth expected in the dates sector ( 4.4% ) given that date exports last year were close to 45,000 tons , worth 114 million dinars .
seafood exports are also expected to rise this year by 2.9% to 18,500 tons . it should be noted that 18,000 tons of seafood products worth 175 million dinars were exported in 2005 .
as for imports , the current year is stable at a total value of 990 million dinars , the same rate as 2005 at around 992 million dinars .
cereal imports are expected to grow by about 13% to 439 million dinars versus 338 million dinars last year . the reason for this is that production in this area fell to 1.8 million tons after reaching 1.2 million tons last year according to the economic budget while imports of other products will fall according to the same source .

chinese law protects women 's rights / fifth addition /
abortion also remains a thorny issue for legislators .
selective abortion of female fetuses and the killing of female infants are prohibited in the draft amendment dealing with the imbalance in new births in china .
the percentage difference is 100 females per 117 males in children according to the 5th national chinese census for 2004 .
in spite of this , some legal experts do not want legal measures to be taken against such abortions and see it as a woman 's right of choice in giving birth .
d. xia says :
" it is a good idea to correct this discrepancy but selective abortion cannot be regulated without a whole host of restrictions for all situations since there is no way of proving why a woman takes the decision to have an abortion " .
the draft amendment is also raising concern among the general public , with the exception of academic circles .
yan xiao xing ( 50 years ) , an employee in nanjing , sees that society has provided women with many opportunities over the past decades and that the social status of women needs to be improved a great deal .
she says , " the main issue is that we as women must take it upon ourselves to broaden our horizons and apply ourselves to serious learning so that our knowledge increases and our awareness increases in terms of equality of the sexes and self - confidence too .
if you are not ready and able to compete , you have only yourself to blame . "

russian legislator expresses concern and urges calm about the controversy raised by the cartoons
moscow february 6 /xinhua/a senior russian legislator has expressed his concern about the publication of cartoons of the prophet mohammed .
he urged calm to be maintained today , monday , amid the increasing controversy surrounding these drawings .
interfax news agency said the constantin kosachoyev , president of the chamber of deputies ' foreign affairs committee at the russian parliament , the state duma , said , " we feel concern about european behavior , not only in the beginning when a media organization in one of these countries published the cartoons but also with regard to subsequent behavior " in re - publishing these drawings in several other european countries .
twelve of the offensive cartoons about the prophet mohammed , published in a danish newspaper last september and re - published in other european countries , led to disturbances in the muslim world .
any depiction of the prophet , whether negative or positive , is blasphemy in the eyes of most muslims .
violent protests broke out in syria and lebanon where angry demonstrators set fire to the danish and norwegian missions in their country .
the editor of the danish newspaper issued an apology last week to angry muslims , after a long period of refusing to apologize and insisting on the right of freedom of expression .
kosachoyev said , " it is up to the international community , in the wake of this apology , to respond forcefully to violence " and called for this to end immediately .
he said that the reaction to the publication of these drawings should only be political and never through the use of force .

savings deposits at 46% in china
beijing february 9 / xinhua / the percentage of savings deposits in china is 46% to date .
the level of private financial deposits reached 14 trillion yuan while institutional financial deposits were 10 trillion yuan , something that has caused widespread concern within the local banking sector .
zhou xiaochuan , chairman of the people 's bank of china ( central bank ) said recently that the rise in the level of citizen savings deposits was linked to many factors such as traditional culture , social structure and the concept of family in china but that the incompleteness of the social security system was an important reason for people 's lack of courage in spending .
zhou said that the incompleteness of the social security system was a temporary phenomenon and that the government must be quick to reform the pensions , medical insurance and education systems in order to reduce " preventive saving " by many citizens until the level of savings deposits and the gross national product fall to normal levels .
professor wu chi of the economic management department at beijing 's tsinghua university predicts that china will see a high level of savings deposits for another 10-20 years .

a spokesman for the foreign ministry said that " democratic korea attaches great importance to the lifting of financial sanctions because this is the yardstick that will reveal whether washington wants to change its policy or not . "

the spokesman , who condemned the latest statement issued by the american state department stating that financial sanctions are a separate issue from the six - nation talks , said that the united states had frozen the assets of eight democratic korean companies , accusing them of " spreading weapons of mass destruction " and " illegal trade " .
he warned that a peaceful settlement by way of negotiations about the nuclear issue would be impossible without the united states lifting financial sanctions against pyongyang .

egyptian people 's assembly decides to postpone local council elections
cairo february 15 / xinhua / an egyptian parliamentary source said today , wednesday , that the egyptian people 's assembly approved a draft bill yesterday evening , tuesday , presented by egyptian president hosni mubarak to postpone local council elections for two years .
the same source , a member of the ruling national party , told xinhua in cairo that the people 's assembly in a session yesterday evening , tuesday , approved the postponement of a draft bill to extend current local council terms by two years , which means postponing elections that were to be held in the next two months .
the source said that the council saw many heated debates between muslim brotherhood deputies , official opposition parties and a number of independents who object to the draft bill , on the one hand , and the ruling national party deputies , on the other .
he said that he regarded the proposal that local councils should continue their term for another two years until elections are held , in accordance with a new vision for the management of local administration provided for under the terms of a new law , as being in keeping with the requirements of the constitutional reform aimed at by president hosni mubarak 's program .
he said that holding elections now and in accordance with current legislation for local administration would mean that the councils created by such elections would not be in line with what the new local administration law has introduced with regard to a vision and direction that supports local administration and consolidates their executive and supervisory powers .
the source said the two year postponement decision was in keeping with an important practical consideration because postponing the elections for just one year would make the local council elections coincide with the shura council 's mid - term elections which begin in april 2007 , a situation which practical considerations prohibit and that in view of the above , the text for the draft bill provides for existing local councils to continue their term for another two years .
the egyptian shura council approved the postponement of the local elections two days ago .
it should be noted that the term in office of current local councils ends next april 15 and local council elections are , according to law , to be held within a period of 60 days prior to the end of their terms .
opposition parties and political forces in egypt have rejected the shura council 's decision to back the bill to postpone the elections and accuse the ruling national democratic party of trying to stop them fighting the elections and marginalizing their role in the local arena .

erekat sends urgent letters to international community to put a stop to israel 's plans
gaza february 16 / xinhua / saeb erekat , head of the negotiations department of the palestinian liberation front , sent urgent letters today , thursday , to a number of countries asking them to intervene immediately in israel 's plans to isolate the jordan valley and divide up the west bank .
the statement issued by the department , sent to xinhua , said that the letters were sent to each of the american deputy secretary of state david walsh , the united nations under secretary - general alvaro de soto , the european union peace envoy mark otte , the russian peace envoy alexander kalugin and the ambassadors , consuls and attachés of the european union , latin american , asian and african countries and canada , australia and japan .
the statement said that the letters stressed that " continued operations and attacks mean the peace option will fail and prevent the establishment of a palestinian state along the june 4 1967 borders , and that they fall within a policy of imposing and dictating on the ground rather than through negotiation . "
the statement said that " isolating the jordan valley area is a preliminary to annexing it to israel . this decision presages a real humanitarian disaster where 2 million palestinians are prohibited from entering an area that covers a third of the west bank . "
the statement went on to say that " continuing to build the isolation wall and annexation creates a racist order in the west bank while annexing east jerusalem , cutting off the jordan valley , intensifying settler activities and continuing to requisition water sources means the israeli government is implementing a long - term transitional plan or a state with temporary borders in return for a long - term ceasefire . "
the statement warned that " implementing these plans means a humanitarian , agricultural , educational and health disaster for all the inhabitants of the jordan valley . all the water in the jordan valley area and in most of the agricultural land has been taken over by israeli settlers , some 8,000 of them , in addition to their setting up industrial residential and animal breeding colonies .
