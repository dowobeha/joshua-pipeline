human rights are basic principles and key values we have striven to include in the constitutional reform proposed to our nation , so that the country 's constitution will be the strength to recover from the authority of our political system , reflecting our cultural program , our society 's progress and its conscious membership of the very best of what humanity has produced in terms of values .
these are values we have established and included in the constitution because there is no going back on them , thus reaffirming our view of the inseparability of civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights , as well as their complementarity rather than giving preference to one or the other .
through them , we reject discrimination in all its forms and the policy of double standards in all its rationalizations , and just as we reject specificity as a cover to break away from these universal principles and values , we refuse that these same principles and values should be used as a way to cancel out the cultural and civilizing characteristics of nations .
the creation of an advisory council to widen the scope of the populace 's representational forms with the legislative authority and establishment of the principle of participation as the basis of democratic practice is at the same time an accompaniment to the progress seen in all fields and an interface with the vitality of civilian society throughout the years of change .
it is an advance for the legislative authority , in terms of its composition and forms of representation , which supports the republic 's values and reinforces its institutions , and gives vital forces and national capabilities a higher standing .
this council will give professional organizations a voice through its members composed of workers , professionals and farmers , those organizations which abound with resources and with a long - standing history of struggle .
establishing an information and communications society is a vital national choice for tunisia that we have worked to embed within the framework of a comprehensive approach through continued structural reforms and pattern of growth for communication and information technologies in our country , which we see as being one of the most important of pillars of the information economy and a basic factor in driving forward .
we have essentially worked toward developing human resources through setting up a comprehensive plan to expand media studies at various educational levels and by creating higher institutions to study technology .
this is in addition to increasing the training of specialists in communications and information technology , developing their skills in modern technology and consolidating its usage in the service of development , as well as setting up technology centers and spaces for new projects throughout the country .
we have also concentrated our efforts on spreading digital literacy on a wide scale especially organized programs in the various media and by the creation of specialized information centers for children throughout the republic , and by linking up educational establishments at all levels , primary , secondary and universities , to the internet , in addition to expanding information and internet clubs in educational establishments and the creation of a network of internet centers open to the public ,
as well as giving middle - income families subsidies and incentives to acquire home computers on a wide scale .
tunisia has special and traditional relations with the united states of america which are based on mutual trust and respect , relations which go back to the eighteenth century , 1797 to be specific , the date of the first the first trade agreement between tunisia and the united states .
without a doubt my visit to this friendly country , for which we have full respect and admiration , falls within the context of regular and intensive discussions and contacts between officials at the highest level of the two countries and comes within the framework of the two countries ' solid relations .
we believe that tunisia , through its special geographic location as a bridge between the two sides of the mediterranean and through its legislation and the incentives it offers investors , offers the perfect foundation for further investment and joint projects .
the message we carry with us stems from tunisia 's past and its present because we confirm our country 's deep - rooted faith in the values of justice , freedom and democracy and its constant striving for peace and stability in the world on the basis of solidarity and forgiveness between nations and peoples , values we share with the friendly american people .
firstly , i note that there is no holdup with regard to democracy and freedom of expression in tunisia starting from the basis that the founding of every democratic society is inseparable from comprehensive developmental work .
these are two courses we have taken care to move forward with determination and resolve without giving preference to one over the other . this is why we have based our agenda on an approach which links civilian and political rights with social , economic and cultural rights since we are aware that human dignity can only be achieved with the provision of the factors necessary for a decent life by firmly establishing the right to health , education , work , housing and protection of the family , children and women and supporting the poorer sections of society and those with no security , alongside ensuring freedom of expression , political regulation and the reinforcement of democracy and plurality .
economic and social progress would not have been achieved were it not for the weight accorded in our country to each person 's opinion , the sanctity of his rights and the dignity of his position .
we have backed gradual progress as the method for establishing democracy and plurality which bolsters us against regression and setbacks and we have taken into account the failed experiments of others , in addition to what has threatened our country and the stability of our society and its progress from the dangers of those who hide behind religion .
we have taken big steps in the area of human rights , which there is no space to enumerate here , and we have consolidated the institutions and mechanisms which protect them in accordance with a comprehensive and integrated vision of these rights .
the countdown toward war , it appears and is apparent , has started and the efforts we have made so far with the sole aim of preventing the war must move in a new direction which is to guard our cherished country and its valued citizens against its effects and consequences .
to protect this country , its scared sites , its security and its safety , your government has made the following decisions , decisions which i have not the slightest doubt , god willing , are a reflection of your basic principles and in keeping with your arab and muslim values , and will meet with your total approval .
firstly : the kingdom will in no case take part in a war against iraq and its armed forces will not under any circumstances walk on a single inch of iraqi land .
secondly : we expect the war to end as soon as security council resolution ( 1441 ) concerning the disarmament of weapons of mass destruction is implemented and we totally and utterly refuse that iraq 's unity , independence , resources and internal security should be touched or that it should be subject to military occupation and we have informed the united states of saudi arabia 's unambiguous position .
thirdly : the exceptional circumstances surrounding this crisis for the past twelve years calls for us not to enter into another uncalculated adventure which exposes our safety , our country and our people to danger .
however , we also have to say that if events were to take a course other than the one we have outlined , or if the war goes beyond its stated aims then we will take another approach , for every event has its own story .
my country has had the honor of acting as the president of the plenary session of the arab satellite communications organization ( arabsat ) for the past year .
during this period , and thanks to your enlightened recommendations and the solidarity of efforts at all levels of the organization , the organization has achieved considerable profits exceeding all expectations amounting to 74 million dollars , a 56% increase compared to the results for 2002 , reflecting the faith of those who work with this organization and the soundness of its approach .
your presence here in spite of your many commitments is a clear expression of the special importance your government accords the development of the communications sector and its profound awareness of the strategic role this sector plays in the economic and social development of our countries .
advancing and developing the communications sector today is at the very core of our countries ' and governments ' concerns because of its importance in bridging distances and strengthening ties between nations and countries , as well as in facilitating the exchange of information and galvanizing exchanges and services in all vital areas , a matter which is of great benefit to all cultural , economic and social activities in order to make use of the latest technological developments .
there is no doubt that arabsat , this pioneering arab organization , has played a vital role in bringing together the peoples of the arab countries , and these peoples and the peoples of other countries , through the many and varied services it offers on all levels through its system of satellites .
the organization has taken several steps in the right direction .
on behalf of my country , please allow me , ladies and gentlemen , to congratulate the african commission for human and peoples ' rights on the skillful work it has done to promote and protect human rights on our african continent .
the occasion of the thirty first session provides a good opportunity for me to confirm once again the islamic republic of mauritania 's commitment to islam and the principles of democracy as defined by the international human rights charter and the african charter on human and peoples ' rights , two charters which are regarded as the basis of our country 's constitution which was passed in a referendum in july 1991 .
this constitution , which gave rise to a state of law and protected and consolidated basic freedoms and a multiplural democracy , guaranteeing the independence of the judiciary and thus granting human rights a constitutional quality , states that : the freedom and dignity of a human being and his right to equality is only guaranteed in a society which gives rights a priority .
in this sphere , i would like to mention that since the constitution was brought in , the general authorities have worked and intensified their efforts to consolidate the framework of implementing human rights by adapting and revising various laws , which clearly and unambiguously set out the guiding principles and the personal commitment of president maawiya walad said ahmed al-tayi , with the aim of improving the course and performance of our democracy and integrating all marginalized sections , advancing women , protecting children and involving the civilian population in the effort to develop the country .
it is appropriate to mention here reforms relating to the administration , judiciary , education system , election system , political party funding , the civic situation and the recent ratification of the personal affairs register since these reforms that have had positive effects on improving human rights .
first of all , i would like to thank you for your warm and delightful reception , something we have become accustomed to each time we visit this esteemed historic town .
the aim of this visit is , as mr. al-amda mentioned in his speech , to lay the foundation stone to rebuild and enlarge alnima airport in order to make it an international airport capable of handling big planes , to inaugurate the launching of a mobile telephone network in the town and to open a tourist resort in it .
in a few days ' time , a water project will be inaugurated , and we know that the water system for the town will provide large quantities exceeding the needs of drinking and will allow it to be used for agriculture and to set up factories and economic projects .
without electricity , water and communications , comprehensive economic modernization of real worth is not possible , and these means are now available in the town of alnima , praise god .
during this visit , we wished to draw the attention of businessmen , manufacturing cooperatives and various active national economists in alnima that the time has come for investment within the country , especially in the town of alnima .
first of all , i would like to thank you for your warm and delightful reception .
the reception was splendid and joyful , something we have become accustomed to each time we visit this beautiful region .
the aim of this visit is to keep in contact with you and to talk to you about national and local issues of concern to you and to provide you with information about the strides we have made along the path of development .
as you know , the general situation is relatively good .
on the economic front , economic performance is improving constantly and the yearly growth rate is rising consistently while the rate of inflation is falling and the markets are prospering .
in general , the country is stronger economically and there is no cause for concern ; to the contrary , all the indicators are promising and it will be possible to reduce our debt by allocation of large sums which will be spent in order to improve peoples ' standard of living and provide basic social services .
in opening this speech , i would like to pass on to you the greetings of the president of the islamic republic of mauritania , muawiya walad said ahmed al-tai , and his wishes for the prosperity and success of this summit 's work .
on this occasion , and on behalf of the president of the republic , i would like to warmly congratulate his highness sheikh ahmed ben khalifa al thani for his valuable initiative and the good conditions provided to ensure the success of our summit here .
here i would like to thank the authorities in the brother state of qatar for the warm reception , generous hospitality and great consideration we have met with .
on this occasion i would like to pay tribute to the prompt efforts made by the secretary - general of the organization of the islamic conference , abdullah wahid balqaziz , in the interests of our organization .
this is an emergency summit , held in circumstances characterized by the enormity of the challenges faced by our nation and the great dangers besetting it , which require greater cooperation and solidarity from us all .
with regard to the iraqi crisis which we are discussing today within the framework of this summit , we must make every effort to avoid war and the further suffering of the brotherly people of iraq , which exposes the region to many dangers , and work to find a peaceful solution based on international law and the implementation of security council resolutions .
in less than one generation , we have seen the fastest advance in freedom in the story of democracy which spans two thousand five hundred years .
historians in the future will give their accounts of the reasons which led to this happening , but we already know some of the reasons they will mention .
it is no coincidence that this large number of democracies appears at the same time as the most powerful countries are themselves democracies .
the united states has made military and moral pledges in europe and asia which have protected the free countries from attack and created the circumstances under which new democracies can flourish .
by providing entire countries with security , we have also given inspiration to oppressed nations , in prison camps , in meetings of banned unions and in secret churches .
men and women have realized that the world as a whole does not share their same nightmare .
i come today to put before you four indisputable facts in order to point out two truths :
the first fact i want to start with is that iraq 's long night is over .
the harsh experience of subjugation , oppression , tyranny and humiliation the iraqis have lived through over the past three decades has ended with the fleeing of the regime 's head and his followers and the collapse of the symbols it erected in baghdad and throughout iraq .
the second fact is that the liberation of iraq - and what took place was unquestionably a liberation - would not have taken place were it not for the determination of president bush and the coalition countries , led by the united states and united kingdom .
as we hear voices of doubt raised about the intentions of the american and british governments , we invite them to visit the mass graves , the drained marshes and halabja and to examine the lists of missing persons whom the regime deprived of life .
the third fact is that the liberation was an embodiment of the entire iraq ' nation 's desire and came as a result of the persistent efforts by iraqi groups opposed to the previous regime over the space of many years who gave hundreds of thousands of martyrs , the most recent of which was ayatollah mohamed baqr al-hakim and his colleagues , god rest their souls , last august , on iraqi martyrs day , who have written another page in the iraqi annals of heroism and the martyr aqila al-hashimi to whom the hand of betrayal extended .
we have committed ourselves to change and development and taking the reins of the initiative without faltering , whatever the difficulties , for jordan 's roots remain solid and stable within its environment and within the world because jordan with its hashemite message is a pioneering jordan , the jordan of examples and ideals .
your meeting today is a continuation of the foundation work which goes hand - in - hand with the constitution , confirming your legislative and dynamic role , and through you , the hopes of jordan 's men and women are represented , thus embodying their ambitions toward the horizons of a prosperous future .
in keeping with our pledge and faith in the " jordan first " initiative , your noble council represents the future of our men , women and children , in the deserts and in the countryside , in the villages and in the camps and towns . this is why we want a legislative council which excels in its performance and acts as a reference authority for our government when it creates its comprehensive plans and national projects in order to bring about positive change and respond to the ambitions and hopes of our youth , from " jordan first " to the jordan of now and tomorrow .
our vision for the jordan of the future is based on a solid foundation based on the characteristics of jordan as a modern democratic country and an inseparable part of the arab and muslim nation , proud of belonging to it and proud of its hashemite history .
it is totally committed to bringing to light this clear and true image of islam , in theory and practice , in order for " jordan " to be a contemporary model of forgiveness , freedom of thought , innovation and distinction .
here you are , as is revealed by your speeches redolent with the fragrance of jordan , its north and south , its center and its east , its highlands and its lowlands and deserts , on the verge of honoring your national obligations and declaring with your voices with unparalleled clarity , embracing choices to establish multiplurality and freedom , under the supervision of our people and with the blessing of our cherished leader in whom our hopes and dreams reside .
yes , you are about to turn the page to begin the pages of cooperation , coordination , observation , inquiry and consultation .
no one is unaware of the fact that we are in the same vessel , uniting and diverging , concurring and separating , in this our eternal final and sole country and our eternal final and sole throne , jordan , until god inherits this earth and all on it .
you are right in saying that the situation is difficult and the load is heavy and the region is in a state of turmoil .
but all this will neither make our knees quake nor weaken our resolve but with the leadership of the father of al-hussein and the bearer of the scepter of al-hussein , its prestige and its emblems , we will proceed to the destiny of men who have a natural propensity for challenges and success .
over the past four years , you have become acquainted with our leader 's resolve and his iron will , forged out of petra 's rocks , the sword of muta and the glorious deeds of yarmouk , and you have become aware that what has been accomplished in this short time has been remarkable and momentous .
thanks be to god and prayers and peace be on our lord god 's messenger , family and apostles . ladies and gentlemen and respected parliamentarians , opening this session of parliament , we complete the renewal of our constitutional structures , substantiating our firm royal resolve to allow the democratic course to follow a sound path as a choice with no going back , whatever the difficulty of national and international challenges .
and while we may be committed to this qualitative transformation , does this mean we have achieved the perfection we seek ?
we have said many times that there is no democracy without democrats and that democracy is a long and arduous road , not a visual arena for a battle for positions but a committed patriotism and an inescapable pursuit to improve the general condition , especially on a local level .
it can only be safeguarded by establishing a culture of patriotism contingent on political parties and social institutions , and by improving the citizen 's standard of living to a point where he feels it in his daily life .
whatever the structure of elected councils , we will not stop reiterating the basic question : is election an end in itself and the end of a long road ?
no , respect for the people 's wishes requires rejection of the armchair democracy mentality and a commitment to the values of the democracy of growth .
it gives me pleasure to make this speech at the end of the second national meeting on intellectual dialogue , held recently near god 's holy house in mecca , on the theme of " exaggeration and moderation : a comprehensive systematic vision , " a meeting that exemplified the spirit of muslim and national brotherhood and a dialogue held in an atmosphere of mutual goodwill and respect .
the meeting examined important reports prepared by specialists in the field discussing the theme of exaggeration and ended with constructive recommendations in support of national unity and to consolidate the value of dialogue , moderation and forgiveness .
these recommendations will receive due attention by the state .
i look forward to the next meeting which is to be held in medina , the city of our prophet and lord mohamed , peace and god 's prayers be on him , to examine two important issues which are " education and women . "
in addition to an organized discussion at the king abdulazziz center for national dialogue , saudi society is today witnessing a broad dialogue among groups in society and conducted through various media channels .
in principle , dialogue is a positive and healthy phenomenon but we must take every care to ensure a blessing does not turn into a curse because dialogue which does not abide by the principles of dialogue , and its rules and conventions , turns into chaos and causes harm rather than good .
within the scope of current deliberations at the international court of justice concerning the legal situation of the separating wall built by israel in the occupied west bank , the kingdom presented its legal statement to the court at the start of the deliberations where it declared the wall illegal and a glaring violation of the fourth geneva convention and all related international resolutions and charters .
this wall not only isolates the palestinians but is also an obstacle to all peaceful initiatives and solutions put forward to find a just resolution to the dispute and is a unilateral step making it difficult to reach any future solutions . it is also a new reality on the ground aimed at complicating the situation and bringing further encumbrances to the existing central issues of the palestinian - israeli dispute .
with regard to iraq , the kingdom welcomes the results of the fifth meeting of neighboring states held in kuwait recently , where iraq 's participation in the meeting for the first time lent it great significance and positivism and provided an opportunity for an awareness of what iraq needs from its neighbors and what iraq 's neighbors need from it .
the unity of iraq 's territory , respect for its sovereignty and independence , and the iraqi nation 's right to decide its destiny and its political future were declared .
neighboring countries affirmed their readiness to support and back diplomatic and political efforts aimed at realizing the hoped for objectives to enable iraq to play a positive role as an active member of the international community , to build positive relations with its neighbors based on friendliness , respect and peace in accordance with the precepts of international law and to abide by international treaties .
the crystallization of a strong and realistic partnership between us is justified by historical and geographic factors and the needs of the region .
in addition to the benefits of free trade , economic globalization and technological progress now require us to increase communication and dialogue so that we can understand each other better .
particularly in the face of the challenges imposed on us by the colossal events our two regions are going through and which have brought to light many mistaken concepts , and preconceived assumptions and positions in the areas of politics , culture and religion , which we must now face in order to avoid their negative effects on our future .
it gives me pleasure to review with you today some of the suggestions and visions aimed at achieving this end .
beginning at the beginning , i would like to reassert our firm conviction that change and reform are two pressing necessities in the arab world if we want our real hopes for progress and development to be achieved .
reform must stem from within to guarantee the welfare of citizens and respond to their expectations for a prosperous society where the principles of justice and equality in rights and duties prevail .
human development and economic prosperity are the key to a better future for the middle east .
the european community and the arab world can reap great benefits by achieving this objective .
any efforts along these lines will contribute to assisting our collaboration toward achieving peace and stability in this troubled part of the world .
it is vitally important to work to end the occupation and the cycle of violence , sectarianism and terrorism .
we can only achieve this aim through deeper understanding , good intentions and the adoption and implementation of just policies .
we must work to prevent leaving any opportunity for this minority of terrorists and fundamentalists to fill the minds of our youth with hatred , loathing and stereotyped images .
of course , there is a group of countries which argues that the court must not give any advisory opinion on the case as requested by the united nations general assembly .
the argument they present is quite simply the argument put forward in other cases requesting an advisory opinion in order to suggest that the case is ambiguous or that the court would be in danger of a making a predetermined ruling about the negotiations or move away from its judicial specialization .
arguments such as these presented to this court have failed in the past .
at the same time , one notes that these same countries state the opposite , considering that the court should not give an opinion yet they continue to assert their position with regard to the essence of the matter whenever the court attempts to give an opinion .
this is not the issue here .
for example , with the issue of weapons of mass destruction , seven countries argued in written statements that the court should not give its opinion .
i would also like to mention the presence of senior officials from the european commission which is involved in launching the first serious and practical step in the sphere of solid waste treatment covering all lebanese areas ( municipalities and villages ) in order to consolidate balanced and fair development as part of the arla program .
the municipal experiment in lebanon is not a new one because the civilian population has lived it before and is aware of its problems ; it strives to develop and expand its services in cooperation with the relevant authorities and supporting organizations , be they local or international .
the lebanese government , as well as the ministry of the interior and municipalities , have been alerted to the importance of the work of municipalities as local authorities within civilian society which manage public affairs and meet the needs of this society . they facilitate citizens ' affairs and safeguard public health , a matter which is regarded as an urgent necessity in view of the environmental imbalance resulting from industrial development , and if we do not deal with the problem of waste soon , then we will face an environmental crisis .
this is where the importance of cooperation between local authorities across borders arises because science , knowledge and development know no geographic borders and belong to the entire human race .
as a result of considerable cooperation between officials of the european commission and lebanese government , and following the provision of financial support , we are now truly at the solution finding stage . we have passed from identifying the problems and their effects to the study and implementation phase which we regard as the national responsibility of everyone , without exception , and under the guardianship of bodies elected by the people which take full responsibility after they were given powers by law enabling them to achieve the development targets contributing to eliminating the dangers of pollution which passes over no one .
i am delighted to meet the president of the european union commission to lebanon , ambassador patrick reno , to sign the agreement protocol for the funding of solid waste treatment programs in the municipalities , funded by the arla program with a grant by the european union .
the agreement protocol includes the setting up of a separate account worth 10.2 million euros as funding for projects proposed by municipalities for the treatment of solid waste , run by the minister for managerial development and monitored by the european union commission .
the signing of this protocol will secure active backing for municipalities by providing funding for one of the most important problems they face , the treatment of solid waste , which officials in municipal committees have many times brought up as their top priority .
this funding is available for all municipalities in lebanon without exception , be they municipal unions or municipal or village groupings without a municipality ; they can all benefit from this project by simply presenting the appropriate applications .
these applications are examined and selected by a committee on which the ministry of interior and municipalities , ministry of the environment and the development and construction council are all represented .
the agreement protocol covers the creation of a specialized unit at the ministry of administrative development equipped with the technical and administrative know - how to manage this project .
it is now well - established that modern development has three pillars : the state , the private sector and civilian society .
while the state and private sector have huge capabilities , civilian society has very few .
but balanced , fair and long - lasting development cannot exist without civilian society .
on the basis of this observation and on an initiative of its ambassador , our friend patrick reno , the european commission has decided to support lebanese civilian society by providing a donation of one million euros for projects prepared by lebanese non - governmental organizations , and by various unions and associations and all non - profit cooperatives .
funding for each project ranges from 25 thousand to 50 thousand euros .
the financial value of this funding is not the most important issue .
i say this because within the scope of our monitoring of archeological sites , finds , and archeological buildings , we face problems of trespassing and protection against trespassing in a number of areas under different headings and , as a result of this , there is tampering with these archeological buildings and areas and trespassing on archeological sites classified by unesco , threatening this classification .
evidently , we are in lebanon where no one dares to do anything without protection and if , by chance or through greed , they do so without prior protection , then subsequent protection is available because we cannot hold anyone accountable or make a decision against anyone .
we at the ministry of culture , with or without this legislation , send out more than one letter over a period of several weeks on infringements in specific areas and the reason is always political intervention in the area , ministers , dignitaries , activities or the social situation .
if the situation , which is solely an attempt to benefit certain people , continues as it is , it is futile to try to approve legislation for the citizen and legislation for heritage in the general sense of the word .
just rule is an old dream which seduced greece with plato 's " republic , " attracted the arabs with al-farabi 's " virtuous city " and occupied western thinking through the works of hobbs , montesquieu , hegel and marx .
before just rule , islam knew " just ancestry " .
in the arabic language , the word " rule " came to mean not only the administration of public affairs , as is the case in other languages , but also the concepts of justice , knowledge and wisdom which prevailed as a result of " just ancestry . "
the arab dream of just rule collides with many external and internal challenges .
foremost in terms of the external challenges , we mention the occupation by israel of arab land and its continued aggression against the arabs militarily , in the media , economically and culturally , which acts as an obstacle to security , peace and development in the middle east , as well as the lack of arab solidarity in facing up to occupation , aggression , globalization and intense economic competition .
at the forefront of the internal challenges , we mention arab failings in the areas of freedom , democracy , human rights and equality between men and women , as well as the curse of poverty , disease , deprivation , unemployment , pollution and it illiteracy .
the male and female trainees who we present with certificates today embody two allied principles at the top of the priorities of every administrative board . these are developing human resources and serving the citizen .
since its creation , the ministry of administrative development has worked along two lines related to these two principles : human resource training in the administrative and technological fields in addition to training elements in private projects , such as the improved performance projects , and the provision of quality services to citizens with cost and time savings through the dissemination of a new administrative culture and mechanisms for procedural simplification .
i am pleased to join the ministry of finance , and particularly the owned properties taxation office , in giving out these certificates to 68 officers from all districts who have trained for ten weeks at a cost of about 30 thousand euros , funded by a grant from the european commission as part of the arla project .
firstly , i would like thank the european commission in the person of our ambassador friend patrick rono .
i would also like thank the finance institute for hosting us and masterplan for its excellent training .
i would particularly like to thank the joint work team of the ministries of finance and administrative development for their efforts in making the training process a success .
first of all , i would like to thank his excellency minister fuad al-saad for launching the " citizen charter " project and his excellency minister karin baqradoni for following up this initiative , as well as all members of the work team who have managed to produce a first draft for the citizen 's charter on the matter of public funding .
in the agreed sense , a charter is a text which outlines specific visions and sets out duties which must be conformed to by those concerned in order for the vision to be achieved , making the charter a moral pillar for the visions and a tool for achieving them .
with regard to the subject of finance , i must quickly remind you that since the conception of the seed of what we now refer to as a body in the state 's name , finance has been its mainstay , with taxes and duties subsequently becoming the main source of the finances needed by the state to manage its affairs and to achieve and implement the services expected and required by citizens of the state .
as a result , taxes and duties have become concomitant with the shaping of all countries .
and so what is called public funding appeared , the theme of the draft charter which we are in the process of discussing .
taxes and duties , which make up the major part of public funding , are collected in the name of the citizen and intended for use to the benefit of the citizen .
our sister country lebanon has accustomed us to being a permanent meeting place and an innovator of ideas , education , culture and science . here we are today witnessing the first opening of an important international meeting to review and discuss what the education , teaching and training industry has come up with in innovations and new technological devices , after seeing a meeting on education and teaching just a week ago in this same place .
there is no doubt that issues of education and the development of human resources are now , more than at any time in the past , the most important factors in the development of countries , a consolidation of their educational presence and an assertion of their true independence in the sharply competitive atmosphere we find our world in today .
in my intervention , i will present a few inevitable future issues which have come up in the form of challenges faced by higher education institutions in the arab world , taking into consideration the relevant factors on the world stage which originally contributed to crystallizing these future issues and challenges that i shall be speaking about .
the first of these factors is the increased demand for higher education :
as you all know , the rapidity of economic , scientific and technological changes and the explosion of knowledge have led to an increased demand for higher education and considerable and unprecedented interest because the world has passed through a period of great transformations which have resulted in a new society , termed the information society , leading to an information economy supported by what are called information workers .
welcome to the symposium on information technology in the development of municipal management ( electronic municipalities ) which opens shortly in the presence of arab and foreign dignitaries and specialists from canada , finland , jordan , muscat and lebanon .
the principal topics covered by the symposium are :
first topic : " introduction to electronic municipalities . "
second topic : " legislative and legal aspects and electronic financial transactions . "
third topic : " changing from manual work to electronic work . "
fourth topic : " practical demonstration of the working mechanism of an electronic municipality . "
we renew our pledge to our martyred heroes and we also renew our pledge to our courageous prisoners in israeli prisons and say to them , we keep our pledge , and your cause is at the top of the palestinian authority 's and fatah movement 's list of priorities , and we say to them also dawn is coming soon , god willing .
on this occasion we state that our nation is being subjected to the most vicious attack any nation has witnessed throughout the course of history , a brutal attack using the most advanced weaponry , and that this nation stands unwavering and says to the whole world we are a nation which believes in its rights and we must have a place in the sun worthy of us and of our struggles and sacrifices .
fatah 's loyal members , and its men and champions , have always been equipped for the responsibility laid on their shoulders . they constantly renew the blood and renew the resolve and determination to continue with the course taken by their leaders who died along the way or who are future martyrs . fatah 's members and champions keep the pledge .
we have total faith that the fatah movement is able to constantly renew its blood , to bestow justice and equality among its members and to spread a democratic climate among its ranks . it is , god willing , at the doors of a new period after this magnificent resoluteness and courageous struggle which our people have fought under the leadership of the fatah movement .
we say to our members : trust that the fatah movement is your movement , a movement of bestowal , a movement of fighters , it is the movement of those who are sincere , not those who want to be first .
as for this tragic and bitter reality that our nation lives through on a daily basis , we ask you dear ones , and every one of you , by means of your position , your work and your relations , individually and in groups , to convey the voice of your just nation and its just cause and what it is subjected to in terms of war , terrorism , aggression and bloody violations and breaches at the hands of the occupying forces and settlers who continue to plunder and steal our land and annex it , to set up colonialist settlement centers and to expand and fill out existing ones .
what is israeli talk of withdrawing from settlement areas other than a smokescreen and a deception of general international opinion .
all this is happening along organized patterns with the aim of legitimizing and entrenching their occupation of our land and holy sites , in order to deprive our nation of achieving its holy right of return and destiny and establishing a palestinian state with holy jerusalem as its capital , by turning our regions into isolated " cantons " unconnected to each other .
it is a much worse situation than south africa 's apartheid , prohibition through military and settlement checkpoints set up along the streets , roads and mountaintops , at the entrances of villages , towns and camps , checkpoints numbering more than 750 .
to you and to the brotherly people of lebanon and to his excellency president emile lahud , i present my salutations and my greatest respect and esteem .
you are embarking on this public demonstration today , which includes all lebanese parties and all the people of lebanon , to proclaim , in your name and in the name of lebanon , no indeed in the name of all arab brothers and all the free and virtuous people of the world , that the noble , proud people of lebanon stand side - by - side with their palestinian brothers in their just struggle against occupation , against settlement , against evil military intensification and against the daily crimes committed against our children , women and people and our very foundations and institutions , as well as against the wall of racial containment , expansion and separation .
and for the palestinian nation to attain freedom , independence and sovereignty in an independent palestinian state , with holy jerusalem as its capital god willing , and for the right of return of palestinian refugees to their country and land and homes they were evicted from by force and aggression and in order to defend our holy sites and release our heroic prisoners and detainees .
from here and from the very center of the blockade imposed on our palestinian people and its legitimate leadership , i say to you , beloved lebanese brothers , thank you from my heart and soul .
on this historic day , the palestinian nation , and with it all noble people in the world , are waiting to hear the voice of international law , of human justice and of international legality as the international court of justice convenes in the hague to pronounce its opinion , on the basis of a united nations resolution , on the issue of the racial containment , expansion and separation wall erected by the israeli government on our palestinian land .
the epitome of this tragedy is the erection of this expansionist , occupational , colonialist and racist wall which has turned our towns , villages and camps into prisons and military camps for mass imprisonment , yet what right has it to deprive our people of its land , to imprison them in these ghettos created by the israeli government ?
at the same time , its occupying army , along with the settlers , practice every form of intimidation , aggression and killing against our people and our land , destroying our foundations in their entirety , razing our farmland , farms and homes , seizing our underground water and withholding our taxes and duties for over three years now !
this is our nation , a brave , patient , resolute nation , in spite of these daily crimes against it by the israeli occupying army and its tanks , cannons , rockets and planes , and its internationally prohibited weapons , and in spite of these inhumane and tragic conditions which no other nation in the world has ever endured .
in reality , the peace process has entered a dark and long tunnel , but we have upheld our proper vision of peace in the service of our palestinian nation , our arab nation and the whole region on the basis of the saudi initiative adopted at the arab summit in beirut .
peace is of definite benefit to the palestinian nation , as security and peace are of definite benefit to the israeli nation , especially for the forces of peace and the people of moses , a nation guided by justice and committed to it . you saw how rabbis and the forces of peace gathered and marched side - by - side with you , in the hague , in jerusalem and elsewhere , against what is being perpetrated against the palestinian people .
our political position springs forth from the good of our nation and from a deep understanding of information and changes which in turn have consequences for our palestinian situation , our arab situation and the situation of the arab world as a whole , and for the peace process in the entire region .
hence our adherence and announcement today , before our revolutionary council , that fatah movement adheres to the option of a just , lasting and comprehensive peace through negotiation and to legitimate international resolutions , the most recent of which is the road map which now represents international legitimacy in all its active forms and has been agreed to in accordance with the russian initiative at the security council .
the resolute , posted palestinian nation today , march 8th , salutes and celebrates international women 's day to affirm its conviction and strong , firm faith in palestinian society 's rejection of any form of discrimination against women .
the only discrimination our nation consents to is positive discrimination in favor of women and their full participation and enablement in playing their fundamental role in forging the future of the nation , side - by - side with men and on an equal footing in terms of rights , duties and opportunities , as declared in the palestinian independent charter because the palestinian woman is the protector of our existence and the permanent guardian of our hearths .
since the early days of the twentieth century and in the face of " sykes - pico , " the palestinian woman has carved her way to complete equality in the right to education and the right to work in all spheres of life , as well as along the paths of freedom and in our the fields of our nation 's battles , resoluteness and adamancy .
women play an active role in general life , in associations , unions and cooperatives and in various combative , political , cultural , educational , economic and social activities , as well as on a national level , be that on the palestinian national or central council or the legislative council , and in the executive leadership on the executive committee or the council of ministers where a ministry dedicated to palestinian women 's affairs exists .
this in turn is a demonstration of society 's recognition and approval of women 's active role in shaping the national decision , and the importance it attaches to women 's issues and the elimination of any kind of discrimination against them , in full cooperation with the general union of palestinian women and all women 's circles and groups .
i call on all lovers of democracy in the world to assist our nation in establishing and restoring its democratic life away from occupation , partitions , and the wall of racial containment , expansion and separation . we affirm here that palestinian democracy and an independent palestinian state with holy jerusalem as its capital are the true guarantees of security , peace and good neighborly relations between us and the israelis and throughout the region .
the continuation of israeli occupation , the persecution , killing , destruction , oppression , building of settlements , sieges , walls and turning our land and towns into prison camps will not build the bridges of trust and will not provide fertile ground for true security and peace .
good neighborliness between the two nations will not be achieved by building a wall for racial containment , expansion and separation which , according to their plans , swallows up 58% of our palestinian land , turning holy jerusalem , the capital of the state of palestine and its christian and muslim holy places , into a ghetto surrounded by walls and barbed and electric wire , prohibiting the palestinians from entering their holy city jerusalem and praying in al-aqsa mosque and the church of the resurrection and closing the historic and religious road to those who pray in holy jerusalem , bethlehem and the church of our lord christ .
what is taking place in jericho and its ibrahimi shrine , what is happening in nablus and its old historic town - for they do not even respect their history , our lord joseph and his father lived there before they departed for egypt - from jenin jarad to rafah jarad , on each bank and everywhere in the gaza strip , there is military escalation , destruction , and assassinations and arrests in accordance with their military plan called " outdoor game " which they have officially announced and which began with the albarij and alnassirat massacres , and before that in jenin . no one knows what today and tomorrow bring , but we are here and they are here , and time is long .
dear brothers : what has taken place in the kingdom recently in the form of explosions in riyadh and the arrest of wanted persons in medina and mecca and other events are matters which require questioning , reflection and investigation into the causes of why such acts occur : what are the constituents of their driving forces ?
how can there be ideas and tendencies that in no way agree with the reality of a country whose course is decided by god 's law , which has chosen god 's book and path of his prophet , god 's blessing and peace be on him , and passed a constitution to govern words and deeds .
is what we saw criminal acts by young citizens targeting people with killing , possessions with destruction and families with terror ?
was the source of this a concept that was born in this land , or an imported idea , or the result of the seduction of a group whose minds have not yet matured , or is this attributable to several many - sided reasons on the inside and outside , and how powerful is this concept and how far has it spread ?
these and other questions , my brothers , are what need to be examined for an answer when we consider the problem of those who violated the country 's true course , choosing the devil 's path and moving away from the rightful way .
in my view or representation , the problem does not reside in a criminal act committed by a criminal as result of criminal desires or tendencies but is bigger than that ; it is a problem of convictions because if a wrong is committed with the conviction that it is right , then we have to look into its roots , roots which form convictions , build beliefs and shape tendencies .
as we open the work of the eighth legislative session of your honorable council , i would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations on the great faith placed in you by citizens from all sections of society to act as true representatives for them , guardians of their welfare and the nation 's welfare and its future and destiny .
i would also like to congratulate you on the fortieth anniversary of the glorious march 8th revolution from which the blessed correctional movement sprung , which promised then fulfilled its promise , where the first people 's assembly for about thirty - two years was held , followed by legislative sessions on a regular basis embodying a practical democracy springing from our heritage and suited to our circumstances .
the previous seven sessions achieved wide - ranging endeavors in the field of legislation and monitoring and endorsed many laws by means of which we accomplished a great revival in all spheres .
passing over any academic or scientific definition of revolution , such as a profound change in something or total transformation of the course of history , active revolution , for me , is a continuous reality which follows on from that profound change and is a continued state of development and progress toward what is better .
the industrial revolution for example was not confined to a day or days or weeks .
this is also true of the digital revolution which occurred in the eighties and continues today with great impetus .
celebrating a particular day is symbolic of this change but development and progress are a continuation of that day .
madam president , we welcome you warmly to the chair of this session .
this interest is a reflection of your personal concern and your country 's concern , our friend chili , in confronting the major challenges facing future generations and putting an end to this .
welcome to you .
we would like to offer our thanks to the executive director of the united nations children 's organization , carol bellamy , and to the secretary - general 's special envoy , otono olara , for their valued statements at the start of this session .
we confirm that what they state will contribute to making progress in confronting the challenge that is the suffering of children during armed conflicts .
my delegation has studied the secretary - general 's statement which is presented here and which we believe we should all grant it our attention .
madam president , first of all , i would like to express the egyptian delegation 's gratitude to you and to your country and for chairing this important session . i would also like to present my thanks to the secretary - general and his special envoy , olara otono , for their valuable efforts and contributions in reinforcing and protecting the rights of children during armed conflicts .
i would also like to commend the efforts of carol bellamy , the executive director of the united nations children 's organization ( unicef ) in reinforcing and protecting children 's rights and i confirm my country 's total commitment to supporting all efforts in this direction .
for a number of years , the council has accorded special attention to the issue of refugee children and homeless children within the country forced to flee their homes , as well as children who are put into the army or sexually assaulted , with special attention accorded to young girls given their greater exposure to other risks , especially sexual violence .
this is a laudable effort of the council supported by my country and which it hopes will continue .
but here i would like to draw the venerable council 's attention to a group of children who tend to be overlooked , children under foreign occupation , especially children in the occupied palestinian territories who die daily because of continued violations against their human rights and the oppressive use of violence .
one only has to cast a quick look over the number of child victims of the current conflict to become aware of the importance of dealing with this matter and focusing the spotlight on it .
please allow me to present my thanks to you for holding this open session and providing the opportunity , once again , for member countries to put forward their views and express their concerns on the matter of dealing with illegal trading in small arms and light arms .
i would also like to thank the secretary - general for the report presented on this matter .
i must also offer my thanks and appreciation to mr. abbe , the deputy secretary - general for disarmament affairs , for his presentation of the secretary - general 's report .
the united nations 2001 conference declared the problem of illegal trading in small and light arms a complex and extremely difficult issue in view of the danger it poses to the lives of innocent people , especially children , women and the elderly who have been victims of these weapons , a matter which caused us to call on all countries , especially countries that produce and export these weapons , to make the utmost efforts , through international cooperation , to end this tragedy and find solutions to it .
the extent of the catastrophic damage caused by the issue of small and light arms has become apparent in conflicts which were seen , and are still seen , in certain countries on the african continent and other areas with similar conflicts .
on this occasion , we repeat our call to all countries to abide by decisions imposed by security council resolutions prohibiting the export of small arms and light arms to african countries where armed conflict is taking place .
i am pleased to be able to welcome mr jose ramos horta , timor - lechte 's foreign minister , to our meeting .
we wish him and his government every success in building their nascent country .
i would also like offer my thanks to the united nations secretary - general , mr kofi anan , for his special report through a united nations support delegation to timor - lechte , as well as my appreciation to mr jean - marie kamalich sharma , the secretary - general 's special envoy to timor - lechte .
the secretary - general 's special report comprehensively presents all the major developments in timor - lechte since it was granted independence , the achievements made in the sphere of reconstruction and the challenges it still faces .
please allow us to confirm the correctness of what has appeared in several statements presented demonstrating that timor - lechte is one of the united nations ' success stories as a result of the close follow - up through the efforts of the general assembly and its special committee appointed to end colonialism , the work undertaken by the security council and the efforts made by the united nations general secretariat .
the syrian delegation supports the contents of the report stating that political institutions in timor - lechte have continued to develop and that the progress that has been achieved is astounding .
thank you , mr president , for holding this session .
we congratulate you on your presidency of the council this month and wish you every success .
we thank the chilean delegation for its successful leadership of the council 's work last month .
my delegation would like to thank the secretary - general for his interim report on the matter of recommendations prepared by the security council delegation to central africa , which my delegation had the honor of being part of .
the report presented to the council proves the importance of delegations sent by the council to regions of conflict which become even more important when they are subsequently coupled to prompt work to implement the recommendations arrived at .
my delegation is happy to have accomplished a major part of the recommendations of the delegation which visited central africa in the period june 7-16 , 2003 .
in particular , those related to creating the interim bodies of the democratic republic of congo in many important and delicate spheres , especially the designation of members of the interim government from the eight parties and entities which took part in discussions of congolese groups , and the council of minister 's ratification of a comprehensive group of general policy objectives , including the formation of an integral national army and an integral national police force .
the secretary - general 's interim report concerning progress achieved in the implementation of the recommendations of the security council 's delegation to central africa reflects a fact which the egyptian delegation would like to present to the security council : while there is evidence of a movement in the situation in each of the democratic republic of congo and burundi in a positive direction , the challenges facing the restitution of wide - scale peace in these two countries , and in the great lakes region in general , are still enormous .
more efforts must continue to be made in order to face up to these .
in this context , our delegation would like to bring up the following points :
firstly , it is very important that we recognize that dealing with the post - conflict phase in the central african region requires a " partnership " between interim governments , the united nations , relevant regional and international forces , the african union , non - regional organizations and a community of international donors .
this " partnership " must be contingent on the principle of a " complementarity and balance of responsibility " between the partners .
we now have a much clearer vision of the needs and requirements of the peace making , keeping and building phases in the region , needs and requirements which surpass the limited security concept of peace to a wider list of interconnected and interrelated political , human , economic and social factors which require a complete package of aid , incentives and pressures to be found which may be difficult to translate into practice without achieving the necessary " partnership . "
the subject of " national reconciliation in the period following armed conflict " takes on an obvious importance in the context of the future of the united nations in the areas of making , keeping and building peace .
one cannot minimize the pivotal role of national reconciliation in societies which have suffered the acrimony of armed conflict and its effects on the social fabric and economic foundations of affected countries and regions , as well as its capacity to turn the page on the past and look to a future of peaceful cohabitation and a sense of a unity of purpose and interests .
in our estimation , discussion about the united nations ' role in national reconciliation processes requires a number of issues and factors of the following type to be taken into consideration :
firstly , by their very nature , national reconciliation processes are long - term , with the main element falling within the context of the concept of " building peace , " even though the process of putting in place the foundation structures for its management begins early on in the " peace keeping " stage .
while the characteristics of the united nations ' direct role in the area of peace keeping are beginning to crystallize in accordance with the " al-ibrahimi committee " report , the organization 's role in the area of peace building still requires further definition and guidance to allow an understanding of the practical framework for the united nations ' contribution in the sphere of national reconciliation .
secondly , the requirements and constituents of national reconciliation processes become apparent as a function of the nature of the conflict in question and the historic , cultural , social , political and economic dimensions linked to the conflict 's outbreak .
mr. president , we thank you for holding this session to examine the secretary - general 's interim report concerning progress achieved in the implementation of the recommendations of the security council 's delegation to west africa , which syria had the honour of taking part in .
we would also like to express our appreciation to the secretary - general 's assistant , mr. kalomoh , for his presentation of the secretary - general 's interim report which outlines the steps taken , or to be taken , to implement the recommendations of the security council delegation to guinea - bissau , ivory coast , liberia and sierra leone .
our delegation is happy to see calm restored in guinea - bissau and the interim president and interim government have pledged to conduct legislative elections within the period cited in the interim charter , or before then , in accordance with the national election committee 's advice .
we add our voice to the secretary - general 's voice to say that there is a pressing need for the international community to provide financial backing to allow the local authority to implement its obligations .
as for cote d'ivoire , we agree with the secretary - general that the linas - marcoussis accords must be implemented as quickly as possible by all sides in accordance with the council 's delegation to the region , in addition to the recommendations of paragraph 31 of its report .
our delegation is pleased that president gbagbo , prime minister diara and the new forces have put into practice some of these recommendations in a provisional and continual manner .
i intend to keep to the five minutes allotted to each speaker , even if this means i have to stop referring to the written text of my statement .
i would like , mr. president , to talk about a number of points as an egyptian review of the interim report presented by the secretary - general on the progress achieved in implementing the recommendations of the security council 's delegation to west africa .
firstly , there is the importance of backing cooperation and increasing the capabilities of west africa 's economic community , which is the cornerstone in dealing with the subregional issue of security and peace in this area .
there is no doubt that the community presents an example worthy of appreciation of african capabilities in the areas of peace making and keeping in recent years , starting with sierra leone , via guinea - bissau and cote d'ivoire and ending with liberia .
this in spite of the limited technical and market possibilities available to them .
we agree with the report 's contents concerning the need for a dynamic framework to help the community overcome the obstacles facing it in continuing its notable accomplishment in preventing the outbreak of armed disputes , in resolving them and in keeping the peace .
i would like to present my sincere thanks to all delegations which backed the resolution draft project concerned with offering aid to the palestinian people and ratified by a huge majority a short while ago .
we would also like to express our thanks to the countries which adopted and presented this important project to the general assembly .
i would also like to express our appreciation and gratitude to all funding countries , united nations agencies , regional committees and non - government organizations which offered generous humanitarian and other aid to the palestinian people in the occupied palestinian territory , including east jerusalem .
our nation , which is living in the shadow of extremely difficult circumstances approaching a humanitarian crisis , feels immense gratitude to them .
at the same time , there is no need to say that the majority of this aid comes essentially in the form of humanitarian aid rather than aid for economic growth , principally because of the terrible circumstances created for the palestinian people by the occupying force .
as a result , the pressing issue is that of changing these circumstances in a manner which allows for a real economic growth process .
please allow me to mention some of our comments on the issue presented to us today .
firstly , the security council 's authority and credibility spring not only from it being the mechanism adopted by the world for over half a century for upholding international peace and security , but also from it embarking on confronting the new challenges to peace and security on the regional and international levels and its interaction with , and progress in tackling , these challenges .
the council 's awareness of the danger of illegal trading and diffusion of small arms and light arms and their impact on people in recent years requires the council to take action in order to face this challenge with a gravity and efficacy suited to the enormity of the resultant risk .
secondly , interaction between the security council and general assembly in tackling issues related to the illegal diffusion of small arms and light arms , and the formulation and implementation of a dynamic , long - term strategy to deal with them , cannot be dispensed with .
in this context , the general assembly made commendable progress with its guidelines in late december 2003 by forming a working team with open - door membership to study and draw up an international treaty to mark and monitor illegal small arms and light arms .
we hope this team 's work during the year 2004-2005 is crowned with the desired success in order to consolidate international cooperation in preventing illegal trading in small arms and light arms and putting an end to this .
mr. president , we wished to take part in today 's session through our belief in the importance of the current and ongoing discussions within various united nations agencies on the threat posed by international terrorism to all spheres of the international community 's life , be this its peace and security or its economic and social growth and progress , and what this calls for in terms of the collaborative determination of all countries to face up to it in order to ensure broad international participation in fighting all aspects of this threat .
please allow me to present the following points which we regard as fundamental to our discussion today .
firstly , the issue of terrorism has imposed itself forcefully on the united nations ' working agendas , given that it is an international threat that does not differentiate or discriminate between countries , peoples , religions or cultures .
egypt was , and continues to be , at the forefront of countries that have stated that terrorism is an international phenomenon and , as such , confronting it requires a balanced group approach precluding unilateral procedures and an appeal to cultures , civilizations or religions .
secondly , the anti - terrorism committee has in the past two years succeeded in reasserting the ability of the united nations , through its various agencies , to decisively and actively tackle growing international threats .
from this point of departure , egypt has been the first to cooperate with the committee and present it with reports , thirty reports to date .
