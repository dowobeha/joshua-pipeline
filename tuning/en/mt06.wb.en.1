< headline > why do we moslems rant about demanding application of human rights to the islamic minorities in the west while refusing to apply them to christians in countries where we make up the majority .
< poster > by dr. youssri mustafa , a moslem writer but who opposes terrorism
if our islamic governments , which adopt the moslem religion as the source of their legislations , do not like human rights , particularly the rights of the practice of religious rituals by minorities , this is understood . but for human rights to be looked at with suspicion by elitist and popular parties outside the framework of government , this is something that needs to be examined and explained .
we have indeed noticed over the past years that one of the greatest challenges for human rights and women 's rights groups is the incorporation of human rights into a culture that still refuses to recognize the principles of human rights and their universality .
and as we know , the principal foundation for rejecting human rights is represented by the notion of cultural specificity that argues that the values in our societies are different from the values of human rights which are described as foreign in origin and character .
and in all cases , the dilemma of disseminating the culture of human rights is not just because of restrictions by the state , but besides that , there is a general culture that is being fed by the discourse of cultural specificity that aims at de - legitimizing the universal values of human rights .
in reality , this cultural rejection is a fact that cannot be ignored , and political and ideological non - governmental forces contribute to fueling it . better than ignoring it , one must search for its causes .
i imagine that the values of human rights do n't find an echo in our societies , not because they are foreign but perhaps because they are foreign to the legal and political systems that deal with human rights selectively and with double standards .
it is no secret to the observer that human rights are not rejected as a whole , but in parts thereof . collective rights , for example , are accepted , and so are political rights even if they annoy the government . but they find listening ears with opposition groups , including those that promote the discourse of cultural specificity .
as to personal rights , they are the real dilemma and they are the ones that arouse the discourse of cultural specificity , not only in governments but also with the political and ideological forces that join forces with the ruling authority to create a public opinion that is antagonistic in the name of specificity to the universality of human rights .
so when we talk about the right in development , we feel collective relief and we accuse the other , the foreign , that he is exploiting us . and we talk about the right to form parties , the opposition agrees and the government becomes enraged .
but when the matter pertains to the freedom of intellect and creed or personal rights for women , the discourse of cultural specificity appears to de - legitimize human rights on the ground that they are foreign concepts , and consequently the issue of cultural specificity is not used to confront human rights in general , but in a partial selective manner , specifically when the matter pertains essentially to personal rights and freedom .
therefore , if we are to search for the cause of the lack of cultural legitimacy in the principles of human rights in our societies , we ought to start with our cultural and political position towards personal rights .
that is , we must hold the thread from its beginning by first asking about the extent of the legitimacy of personal rights per se before talking about the legitimacy of human rights .
there is a valuable article by the german philosopher habermas entitled , " on legitimation through human rights " in which he says : " modern laws originate in their core from personal rights . "
those rights enable a legal person to behave according to their own priorities .
thus , those rights discharge the person holding the right in a very qualified manner from ethical instructions or precepts of any other kind .
in any case , no one is legally compelled , within the boundaries of what is legally permissible , to publicly display their endeavors .
habermas points to the import of personal freedom into the structure of modern law , thus becoming different from traditional legal systems , which confirms the principle of hobbs which says : .. everything is permitted , so long as it is not explicitly forbidden , and this is what separates law from ethics .
the separation of law from ethics in modern law is an issue of importance , not because we like the law and despise ethics , but because that is the modern historical logic behind the principle of the rule of law .
it is this separation that has allowed , historically , to constitute persons into essentially legal beings on the basis of the concept of personal rights , which is in contrast to traditional models where persons are essentially moral beings that are constituted and controlled according to the dictates of moral systems based on religion or customs or traditions or even modern political ideologies .
and if modern law is based on the principle of personal rights , ethical discourse is based on a collective universal concept of rights and obligations .
in reality , when the issue pertains to the individual in our societies , we find ourselves living in a three - dimensional framework : in the first dimension , we are legal beings by virtue of a historical evolution that we do not deny . there is a law that governs us , even if that law truncates public and personal rights .
secondly , there are parts of civil law where the religious overlaps with the ethical , with the terrorist as a model of personal laws or freedom of thought and creed , or the practice of religious rights by minorities .
in a third aspect , we are persons who are subjected in large part to purely moral precepts that are more powerful than laws , particularly when the matter has to do with personal rights .
so even that amount of freedom , that is not restricted by the law , is restricted by ethics apart from the law .
such a religious collective discourse , or that which is set forth in the name of customs and traditions , intervenes to impose on the individual patterns of life within a system of non - legal moral rules and restrictions through which the life of the individual is organized , by describing them as moral beings .
some may think that legal rules are in constant competition with moral rules , and to a large extent this is not true .
for the law meets ethics in a positive manner when the law and ethics criminalize together such crimes as murder and theft , for example .
but they also meet in a negative manner to restrict freedom and personal rights .
in our own societies , the law retreats except in its suppressive forms and leaves the stage for moral rules , not because they compete with it , but because these rules play a functional role to the advantage of the authority , that is , the role of social control , especially in the area of personal rights and freedom .
according to this disciplinary formula , an alliance occurs between the three powers : the political power , the religious power and the power of customs and traditions .
whatever cannot be controlled by the law can be controlled by ethics , because there will always be some penalty that befalls the individual even if he did not break the law .
what is noteworthy is that this control operation relies on ethical penalties which may evolve into violence , whereby individuals are categorized not from the standpoint of their adherence to the law or lack thereof , but from the standpoint of an ethical segregation along the lines of the pure and the filthy in the primitive sense .
religious discourse addressed to women relies on a kind of moral sorting , as if to say that the veil is chastity and purity , and consequently she who does not wear the veil is penalized culturally and socially in the sense that she loses her legitimacy from the standpoint of chastity and purity .
we also find this kind of sorting in political ideologies , so we hear those who say , " the honorable citizens , " as an indication that those who do not follow this political program are only citizens , and if they oppose then they are sentencing themselves to be dishonorable citizens .
the language of chastity and purity and honor implies a kind of non - legal penalization for ethical beings .
here emerges the crisis of the legitimacy of human rights , for the language of human rights is fundamentally a legal and humanist language , that is , it is designed to speak to legal beings who live under a political and legal pattern based on citizenship that recognizes and protects the personal rights of individuals .
but the problem , as indicated previously , lies in that the legal being itself does not enjoy a cultural legitimacy , and it is replaced by essentially moral beings .
and on that basis , the discourse of human rights enters into a domain that is foreign to its language and its legal terms , and it is dealt with in a selective way in which the collective is accepted and the personal is rejected .
the legitimization of human rights cannot be established unless there is a collective admission that they are legitimate .
and this admission will not take place if there are powers that fear human rights , and individuals who do not comprehend themselves with the language of the law , which is the language of human rights , but rather with the language of morality which is the language of the political and religious authority and the authority of customs and traditions .
and here comes the importance of defending the case of citizenship , not by describing it as a case of tolerance and shared coexistence , but - and fundamentally - by describing it as a project for civil rights and the reconsideration of the legal personality that is based on personal rights and freedom .

and even cows .... err !!
2/1/1427 01/02/2006badriya al-abded al-rahman
i know that my topic is the hottest topic on the islamic scene these days ...
perhaps it seems to many of you repetitive for me to talk about the danish stupidity which rallied the feelings of moslems all over the world ... and how we were able to read and calm the situation that was a harbinger of things whose consequences cannot stand comment ...
- what 's the story ?
how can we well explain this exceptional behavior ?
can we read , for example , that it was a rude awakening of religious fanaticism in the century of tolerance and non - fanaticism ?
or is it a ruder awakening of anti - religious fanaticism against religion , religions and religious symbols ! ?
it is more surprising that this happens in a calm and peaceful country that is noticeably isolated from international decision - making ... though perhaps its political stagnation , ( not its prejudice ) and its geographical remoteness from the regions of cultural and intellectual clashes with moslems in particular ... and with other cultures in general , is a debatable matter .
that an initiative is taken ( even if exceptional ) by some magazine to provoke the anger of the followers of the islamic religion , which has millions of adherents throughout the world ...
and the more striking is for that provocation to happen not for the sake of doing good or to promote dialogue with the other ... but for the sake of creating an islamic ( scapegoat ) against whom can be leveled accusations , and pre - conceived and pre - determined images ...
this whole scene was a ( danish ) stupidity of enormous gravity , i do n't think it will go down easily in history ... and i do n't think that the country of cows and butter , with its extremely good and benign image , had a need to flex its muscles - when it wanted to flex them - by provoking islamists and moslems in all their various persuasions ...
- why only islam ... ?
and in the biggest symbol for that religion , which is its holy prophet , prayers and blessings be upon him ... then to promote a perfect image of insolence , of precise stereotyping of islam by portraying it as the religion of bombs and death ... categorically ... more than categorically ... because the function of caricature in a newspaper is to corroborate an existing image ... an indisputable truth that only fools challenge . . . !
this is how in all simplicity we reduce and is reduced the long history of a great religion , in a caricature that is insulting to us alone and none other among the religions and the intellectual movements in the world , in the names of many of which atrocities and crimes were committed against the whole world .. so that islam remains singled out on the list of death ...
this is how the sacred is violated and the fanatic transgressions have reached and crossed the red line by hundreds of meters , without the least shame or deference to reason ... as if religions have become cheap merchandise and of no importance to what they represent and do in the souls of their adherents ...
it is in summary ... bad manners and impudence according to the norms of the intellect ... to the norms of politics ... to all norms . nothing expresses this foolishness other than bad manners , after which denmark should not expect any stupid behavior directed at it because of it ... because it was in summary ( more ungrateful and more unfair ) ...
what an evil and miserable image that is ... not only because it is wrong and ugly ... but because it also awakens things that were stored for centuries in the western mind against the islamist ... the islamist of death , the sword , the horse and the beheadings for god ... and nothing more ..
vestigials that found someone to stir them up in order to unsettle the climate of relative harmony that moslems enjoy in the west , and in denmark specifically , because of fanatics ( of any intellectual kind ) who do not realize the danger of what they are doing ...
what has denmark done to itself , by god !
and how can it want to gain our respect after all that has happened !
and how can it feel safe for its citizens in islamic countries , and everywhere else , after the inimical anger that moslems now feel ? !
mere questions , i do n't know if they are turning or have turned over in the danish mind , its public opinion and its decision - makers ... or does this mind remain preoccupied with milking its cows and their butter fat without recognizing the extent of the predicament forced upon it by the editing team of a magazine which now represents every dane in the mind of every moslem . . . ? !
we boycott ... in order to be .. !
joint calls by mobile messages and e - mails to boycott danish products and vilify them are but a healthy and good manifestation and i unreservedly support them ..
since the time of the boycott of american and israeli goods , the arab islamic mind is leaping forth and making its " no 's " numerous , heavy and at times difficult ... but beautifully and worthy of admiration , even if we disagreed with it ...
the international mind should understand that the moslem is no longer member of a group of countries , most of which belong to the third world , that is taken for granted ( when it is absent , they cannot be ordered as they are witnesses ) ... but he has become a cultured person aware of his cultural background , which is the islamic religion , regardless of the diversity of his denominations or the disparity of his adherence to the teachings of the religion ...
the important is that he now knows how to say : no. .. loud and civilized , and in a way that expresses his uneasiness at the arrogance of the westerner against the arabs who need them , seek shelter with them , and stand in lines to obtain entry visas and work there ...
the western arrogance that has lasted and continued and overflowed recently to the point of insulting the sacred ... the scared which is a big red line in all cultures , everyone has the right to object to sarcastic and belittling insults ...
and me , when i say that , i know that my boycott , your boycott and the boycott of all of you wo n't hurt or diminish the prestige of danish butter or its wide reputation ... or its stupid cows ... but we will do it for ourselves ... in order not to lose the only and simple ( no ) that we own now and that fills our mouths ...
to say : we are present , and we are on this planet with all our problems and our crises ... and we are capable of coexisting , and we deserve respect ... and we can express ourselves and refuse ... and even to hate if required ...
so that there is no strife and new hatred that is injected into the sea of hate that moves this wretched planet ... i wish that denmark takes the initiative of a broad and deeply - worded apology to the feelings of moslems and calm the magnitude of the crisis ...
and not to expect that the united islamic heart be cleansed in one stroke and with one apology ... because the magnitude of the shock was strong and removing it wo n't be easy ...
for if this apology wo n't occur , we will spend all our life humming this refrain ... ruminating over the pain of hate ... raising our children and our children raising their children that denmark and the devil are two brothers , what one of them deserves , the other deserves too ...
if this apology wo n't occur , the coals of hate will remain inflamed ... and perhaps denmark will be surprised by what provoked the feelings of moslems ... perhaps it will find a good application for the model of the distressed terrorist with the ( bomb - strapped ) turban in its land and among its beautiful fortresses and its boring cows ...
maybe denmark will lose all its beauty and its naiveté because of its ( big mouth ) ...
maybe this time its cows blathered more stupidly than necessary ...
maybe we do n't need to wait more than a few days to see something we never wished before in denmark ...
maybe everything will happen ( there and here ) ...
how much do i hate ( maybe ) in these contexts ... god , we have had enough evil , maybe . . . !!!

negative and positive self - programming ...
most people are programmed since young age to behave or speak or believe in a negative way , and it grows with them until they become prisoners of what is called " negative programming , " which limits their access to many things in this life .
so we find many of them who say i have a weak personality , i cannot stop smoking , i am poor in dictation , i am ...... .
and we find that they acquired this negativity either from family or from school or from friends or from all those combined .
however , is it possible to change this negative programming and convert it into a positive programming . the answer is , .. yes and a thousand times yes . but why do we need this . ????
we need to program ourselves positively in order to be happy , successful , and live a good life so we can achieve our dreams and our goals . we must do this , particularly since we are moslems and we have a task and a purpose that we must reach to achieve the worship of god , to whom be ascribed all perfection and majesty , and to achieve the succession that god commissioned us for on earth .
before we begin the program of changing negative programming , we must agree on matters , and they are :
you must decide within yourself that you want to change . this decision of yours is what will illuminate your path to changing from negativity to positivism .
a repetition of the actions and words which you will learn and make them part of your life .
now , the first way for positive programming is :
speak to yourself :
have you seen a person speaking loudly to himself as he walks , moves his hand and mutters , and he may be cussing and cursing . sorry , we do not want to act like him .
or has it happened that there was a violent argument between you and some other person , and after the person leaves you , the tape of the argument ran in your mind over again and you began imagining the argument a second time and you started replacing words and terms with others , telling yourself why did n't i say this or that ...
and has it happened that while you were attending a lecture or a speech , you talked to yourself and said : i cannot speak like this , or how can i stand in front of all these people , or you say it is impossible for me to stand in front of people to speak or lecture .
all these discussions and speeches with oneself and ourselves gives the human being a negative programming that may ultimately lead to detrimental actions .
fortunately , you and i , and any person , are capable of acting towards speaking to oneself , and it is in our ability to change any negative programming and substitute it for another new programming that strengthens us .
one psychological engineering scientist says , " we are able at any moment to change our past and our future , by re - programming our present . "
therefore , from this moment we ought to watch and pay attention to the inner calls that your being speaks about .
it was said :
watch your thoughts because they will become actions .
watch your actions because they will become habits .
watch your habit because it will define your character ..
watch your character because it will define your destiny .
and i want to clarify some scientific facts about the human brain , and we focus specifically on the subconscious .
the subconscious is not conscious of things like the conscious brain . it simply stores information and repeats it later on whenever it is recalled from its site of storage .
so if it happens that a message is programmed in this brain for a long period of time and over several times , such as always saying in every situation ... i am shy i am shy ... i have an irascible temperament , or i cannot practice sports , i cannot quit smoking .... and so , such messages will be reinforced and stabilized at a deep level in the subconscious and cannot be changed . but they can be substituted with another sound and positive programming .
another fact is that the subconscious has strange behaviors that we should watch for . for example , if i were to say the following sentence to you : " do not think of a black horse , " will you be able to do that and prevent your brain from thinking . of course not , because more likely you have already thought of a black horse .
why ??
your brain has eliminated the word " no " and kept the remainder of the phrase , which is : think of a black horse .
therefore , is it possible to exploit such strange behaviors of the brain .
let us now present to you the essential point and let doctor ibrahim al-faqi tell us what he stated in his book , " the power of self - control : rules and a practical program for a positive programming of the self . "
he says :
and now here are the five rules for programming your subconscious :
1- your message should be clear and specific .
2- your message should be positive ( example : i am strong . i am ok . i can abstain from ... .
3- your message should indicate the present time . ( for example , do not say i will be strong , but say i am strong . )
4- your message should be accompanied by a strong feeling for its contents so that the subconscious accepts it and programs it .
5- the message should be repeated several times until it is fully programmed .
and now here is this plan so that speaking to yourself has a positive power :
write down at least five negative messages to yourself that had impact on you , for example :
i am a shy person , i cannot refrain from smoking , my memory is weak , i cannot speak in public , i have an irritable temperament , and now tear the paper on which you wrote these negative messages and throw it far away .
write down at least five positive messages to yourself that give you power , and always start with the word " i " , for example :
" i can refrain from smoking " .. " i like to talk to people " .. " i have a good memory . "
" i am an excellent person " .. " i am active and have strong energy . "
write down your positive message in a small diary and always keep it with you .
and now take a deep breath and read the messages one after the other until you assimilate them .
start again with the first message , take a deep breath , and get rid of any tension inside your body . read the first message ten times with a strong awareness , close your eyes and imagine yourself in your new " you " , then open your eyes .
as of today , beware of what you tell yourself , and beware of what you say to others , and beware of what others say to you . if you notice any negative message , proceed to eliminate it by saying , " eliminate , " and replace it by another message that is positive .
be assured that you have the power , and that you can be , and you can possess , and you can do what you want , merely by specifying exactly what it is that you want and that you move in that direction with all the power that you can muster . jim rohn , the author of the book " eternal happiness " said about this , " repetition is the mother of skill " ...
which is why you have to trust what you say , and always repeat to yourself the positive messages , for you are the master of your brain and the captain of your ship ... you rule your life , and you can transform your life into an experience of happiness , health and unlimited success .
and always remember :
live every moment as if it was the last moment of your life .
live with faith , live with hope ,
live with love , live with struggle
and appreciate the value of life .
( by permission from the book " the power of self - control " by dr. ibrahim al-faqi )
and finally , pray for me for guidance , forgiveness and mercy .
amen

head dandruff ... its causes and treatment
i think it 's a very common problem , everyone suffered from it at some point in their life .
in the past they used to think that the cause of dandruff is a rapid growth of the scalp cells , but this belief has been proven wrong .
recently they discovered that the cause of dandruff is a species of yeast called pityrosporum ovale .
the problem appears to be the result of a poor blood circulation in the scalp .
worry .
using hot water when washing hair .
also , the fatty nature of hair plays a non - negligible role .
in some instances , dandruff does not cause a significant problem , but when it falls on the clothes or causes an itch or gives a foul smell to the hair , the problem begins to appear .
elegant appearance and prestige go down the drain and dandruff becomes a question hanging off the mouth in need of an answer .
the question is : ok , how do we treat it ?
there are advices that we ought to pay attention to first , and they are :
1. not to use other people 's combs and brushes when combing hair .
2. pay attention to cleaning one 's personal toiletries ... i. e . wash the brush and the comb at least once a week .
3. wash the head with specific types of treatment shampoos that are available in the markets .
here i recommend the use of nizoral , not to advertise for it or the like , but because this shampoo contains the substance ketoconazole , and this substance is effective in getting rid of the yeasts that cause dandruff .
4. after using the shampoo , rinse your hair with vinegar diluted with water and massage the scalp .
there are also certain prescriptions with good results .
*wash your hair .
rub your hair with apple vinegar .
leave it for a quarter of an hour .
rinse it .
*wash your hair .
mix 1⁄2 cup of apple vinegar and 1⁄2 cup of lemon juice .
rub your scalp with the mixture .
leave the mixture on the head for a period of half an hour .
rub your hair with olive oil and leave it for another half an hour , after which the hair is washed with shampoo .
repeat the operation once a week until the dandruff is eliminated , and you may not need to use this more than once .
olive oil , almond oil and prickly pear oil help re - balance the scalp and nourish it .
greetings and may you stay good .

pain in the red sea
my father put the life vest on me when he saw that the ferry was leaning and was almost sinking .
after that , i saw my father drown , then my mother ,
and i stayed alone for 30 hours fighting the waves , being helped by one escapee , until the rescue forces came and lifted me out of the water .
everything is lost .
i went abroad to saudi arabia for three years during which i suffered a lot .
and i returned with my life 's savings to marry and settle .
but suddenly everything is lost .. everything .
there was a fire in the lower levels of the ferry .
but the crew prevented some passengers who saw the fire from wearing the life vests on the pretext that this will cause an unnecessary state of panic with the other passengers .
then that was the result , as you see .
the ferry sank and with it more than 1,000 passengers .
the ferry crew told us when we saw smoke coming out of the engine room on the lower floor , " do n't worry , we will extinguish it . "
and when things quickly turned to worse we did not find the life boats . some of the workers on board the ferry took them and left us on the boat facing death alone .
30 hours i was in the water , fighting death ,
30 hours without food or water .
my skin was almost melting .
where is the respect for humanity ?
if the ferry passengers were israelis , would they have been treated with this negligence or with this slowness ?
god gave me three children , two daughters and a son , and we were living together in saudi arabia .
then we decided to return permanently and settle in egypt .
so we shipped our home 's furniture and my children 's books and all our belongings .
shortly after we took off at sea , terror seized us as we saw the smoke rising from the ship .
then it tilted on its side and sank .
and i saw my three children and my wife as they screamed and were swallowing water , and i was screaming and trying to rescue them , but god 's will prevailed .
they all drowned before my eyes .
their books and some of their toys were floating on the surface ...
of him is reparation and from him is reparation ..
only god has the power and the might .
when the fire became big , we heard the sounds of explosions in the ferry kitchen .
so we thought they were the result of the explosion of the gas cylinders .
we yelled at the captain to return to port of dubah because it was closer than safaja , but he refused .
after we were all seized by terror the captain ordered us to knock on the doors to get the passengers out of their cabins and gather them on the right side so that the ferry recovers its balance . but within five minutes , everyone was drowning .
screams and wailing rose .
and the men were appealing to god for help , " oh lord , save us .. oh lord have mercy on us
"
and some others were uttering the two shahadas
*****
may god have mercy on the accident 's victims and grant their relatives patience and consolation .

< headline > the chastity of men
< poster > abu suleiman
why is there not more value or respect for the chastity of men ?
and why does the chaste man who rises above his lust arouse surprise and suspicions about himself ??
why has the man who did not have illegitimate sex before marriage become a stupid man in the eyes of some ?
why has the man who does not betray his wife become a coward who is afraid that his wife might discover his truth or who doubts his masculinity ?
our society is very concerned about the woman 's virginity
but why no one talks about the virginity of the man ?
in the time of openness and progress , all means that facilitate succumbing to the forbidden have spread .
temptations now surround us from every side , and are no longer
out of reach . there is nothing easier than the unnatural ways that drag the human being into vice .
but this is not a pretext to justify the sin .
and even if the same temptations face women and men , they are both equal in punishment and accounting .
according to the divine judgment in his almighty 's words : " and say to the believing men that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty , and say to the believing women that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty . "
and whereas the most sound and fair of our behaviors is that we measure them according to the divine judgment and legislation , we see that in the revelation is a clear indication of disseminating the concept to man and woman .
the almighty said : " and the men and women who guard their chastity , and for men and women who engage much in god 's praise , for them has god prepared forgiveness and great reward . " [ al-ahzab : 35 ]
therefore the chastity of the man is no less important than the chastity of the woman , and it does not diminish his masculinity , and because of this , the chastity that is asked of the woman is also asked of the man .
and we must disseminate the concept of virginity to include man and woman together , so that there is an equivalence .
but in our eastern societies where the concepts have confused ,
virginity has become required only of the woman , for it is her capital asset and the foundation of the honor of her family .
but the virginity of the man , it 's not a problem .
nothing sullies it , from the standpoint of the principle that any sin is allowed so long as it is not exposed before people .
so this is a call to everyone to demand chastity and strengthen themselves against the forbidden .
and to eliminate the widespread belief that the chastity of a man is a suspicion from which the man is ashamed , and he avoids it so that he is not accused of retardation , little culture and poor experience .
the chastity of a man means his modesty , which is an honorable trait that embellishes its bearer . with it , man keeps faith and becomes upright . he stays clear of sin and the wrath of the lord of the worlds , and he protects his health from diseases .
chastity starts from the heart to reach the level of the body , and it is in a man a clear evidence of the power of his personality , his pride and his abstaining from fornication activities , the repression of lustful feelings and the discipline of the self against being driven by its passions .
the chaste person is wise and capable to control all his inclinations and instincts , and he does not satisfy them except through those things that please god .
he is a patient human being with integrity . he rises above falling to the vices of things , and he stays above his lust .
he possesses a rare character that only those whose faith is strong can muster .
in the revelation , there is a prayer for every single person .
" and let them be chaste those who do not find marriage "
thaalab explained it , saying :
" and let him control himself as with the fast , for it is honorable . "
and chastity is required of the married and the unmarried ,
for how many men betray their wives and brag at their gatherings of their adventures so that they do not appear before the others to be of a lesser standing or that their masculinity is diminished or that they become the subject of ridicule .
my dear brother , i ask you not to weaken and to keep your purity and chastity ,
and not to succumb to temptation ,
and try to strengthen your faith in god .
if you weaken , remember that god sees you and that you will , and we all will , be asked about our deeds , and your masculinity will not intercede on your behalf for your lord to forgive you , because the divine word is clear .
chastity is not only demanded from the woman , but it is an obligation on every human being .
and do not make of society an accountant of your deeds .
for if you are saved from the accounting of this world , you will not escape the punishment of the afterworld .
and remember that death does not ask permission of its subject .
when it comes , it will not delay until you repent .
for when their term is reached , not an hour can they delay , nor can they an hour advance .
so if you are pleased with the worst of deeds , do no expect and do not ask for goodness out of life .
and remember that the reward is of the same kind as the deed .
if you are put to the test , do not expect god to give you a good wife .
god almighty says in the sura of al-nur : " women impure are for men impure , and men impure for women impure , and women of purity are for men of purity , and men of purity are for women of purity . these are exonerated from what people say , for them there is forgiveness and an honorable living . "
"
god , i ask you for chastity and prosperity
"
we ask god to keep away from young moslems all misfortune and harm .
for god is the great protector and the most merciful of all .

they tied her up ..
and they deprived her of her senses ...
and she felt she was placed on something like a howdah .. in its elevation and movement ...
she heard the voice of her lover among them .
why does n't he chide them ... / ?
why does n't he prevent them from taking her . . . ? ? ? ? / ?
the sound of monotonous steps walking on coarse sand ...
and cold morning breezes touching her white clothes ..
and though she ca n't see , but she imagines the environment around her to be foggy ...
and she imagines the soil on which she is now to be desolate and lifeless
..
finally , the steps stop all at once and she felt she was being put on the ground ..
and she heard next to her stones being lifted and others being put down ..
then she was carried again .. and silence spread around her ... and she felt darkness gnaw at her bones ...
and from above came to her ears a whimpering voice ... it 's her son .. yes him ...
perhaps he is coming to rescue her ?? / ?
but ... what is she hearing ?? / ?
he is calling her with a low voice : mother ..
and from between the tears her husband speaks to him , saying : hang in there ...
for patience comes with the first shock ...
pray for her , my son ...
let 's go ..
he is overwhelmed with agony ...
and look one last time on the prostrate body ... he could not control himself in saying with a voice dripping with pain : there is no god but god ...
there is no god but god ...
we belong to god and to him we shall return ..
this was the last i heard from him ..
then the sound of a marble stone falling from above rang out to close the only opening that was the source of the voice and the light ....... and the life .........
the sound of the steps moving away ...
where to ? ? ? / ?
where are you leaving me ? ? / ?
how do you abandon me in this solitude and this darkness ??
she looked around her , and she sees .......
sees ? ? ? / ?
anything she can see in this black tunnel ? ? / ?
its darkness is not like the darkness of the night she is used to ... that one is accompanied by moonlight .. and the radiance of the stars which reflects on things and people .. but here , she can barely see her hand ... in fact she feels that her eyes are completely closed ..
she remembers her loved ones
and she heard the steps completely disappear , and a chill ran through her limbs
she stood up wishing to follow them ...
how do they leave her and they know that she dreads darkness and solitude ? ? / ?
but a heavy hand violently forces her to sit ..
she stared at what was behind her with immense fear ... and she saw what she never saw before ...
she saw terror embodied in the form of a being ...
but how does she see him through the intense blackness ? ? / ?
she said with a shivering voice : who are you ? ? / ?
then she heard a voice to her right ringing out in reverberations ...
she turned around ..
there stood a being similar to the first ..
while she stood silent in her weakness ...
she wished the earth would swallow her so she would n't see these people ...........
but she remembered that the earth has indeed swallowed her ..
she wished for death to flee this place from which there is no escape ...........
she returned to her wishes that were no longer useful ... for she is dead anyway ..
- who is your lord ?
- huh .. - who is your lord ? ? / ?
- my lord .. / ?
i have worshiped no one but god all my life ..
- what is your religion ??
- my religion is islam ..
- who is your prophet ? ? / ?
- my prophet ? ? / ?
her memory was wringing ..........
what 's the matter with her , she forgot his name ? ? / ?
did n't she always repeat it with her tongue ? ? / ?
did n't she pray over him in the moslem pledge five times a day ? ? / ?
with an angry voice , the voice asked again : - who is your prophet ? ? / ?
- one moment , please ...
i ca n't recall ..
a thick baton went up in the hand of the being ... and then came down rapidly towards her head ..
then she screamed ...........
and her limbs went stiff ...
and suddenly his name lit up in her mind :
and she screamed at the top of her lungs : - prophet mohammad ...
mohammad ...
then she shut her eyes strenuously ... but ........... nothing happened ..
a deadly silence ..
she opened her eyes wondering
the being , whose name is nakir told her : " a prayer you always repeated saved you ( my god , oh reverser of hearts , settle my heart on your religion ) . "
a shudder went through her body ..
she wanted to smile out of joy ... but she could n't ...
this is not the place to smile ....
my god , when will those difficult moments end . . . . . . . . . . . / ?
a little later , nakir told her : " you were delaying the dawn prayer .....
her eyes turned sad ...
she knew there is no escape for her this time ...
because he did not skirt the truth ...
he pushed her in front of him ...
she wanted to cry but her tears found no course ...
she walked in front of munker and nakir in a long tunnel until she reached a place that looked like detention camps
...
she felt nausea ...
and wished she would faint ... but it did not happen ...
so she continued looking at the terrifying place ...
in every corner there was screaming and blood ..
wailing and distress ...
and bones breaking ...
and bodies being burned ...
and hard faces from whose hearts mercy was removed , and they do not respond to all this pleading ..
the two kings pushed her from behind and she walked feeling her feet incapable of carrying her ...
and suddenly she approached a man lying on his back ..
and right above his back was standing a king from those with the cold hard faces ..
carrying a heavy stone ...
and before her eyes the king dropped the stone on the man 's head ... which smashed and separated from his body , rolling ...
she screamed
.. she cried ..
then she was so stunned that it tied her tongue ..
but quickly the head returned to its owner ..
and the king went back to dropping the rock on it ...
here .. she was told : - come on .. lie down next to that man .. - what ? ? / ?
- come on ..
she was violently pushed ..
she started resisting ..
and resisting ..
and resisting ..
to no avail ..
her fate is indeed dark ..
really dark ..
she dropped down with terror almost tearing at her guts ..
she called god for help
she saw all the doors of prayer closed ..
the era of calling for help in distress is gone forever
but if only she prayed during her prosperity ..
if only she prayed in this life ..
if only she would return to pray twice on her knees
.. only twice on her knees .. to intercede for her ..
she looked up and she saw a king standing over her
lifting a powerful rock with his hand ..
saying to her : - this is your suffering until judgment day ... because you were derelict of your duty ...
and as despair overwhelmed her ... she saw a young man like a half moon hurrying his steps to her location ..
she was overcome by a feeling of hope ...
for his face is full of happiness and his smile illuminates everything around him ..
the young man arrives and extends his hand to stop the king ...
so he said to him : - what 's come to you ? ? / ?
- i was sent for her ... to protect her and stop you ??
- is this a command from the great and almighty god ? ? / ?
- yes ..
she could n't believe her eyes ...
the king is gone ... he disappeared ... and the young man with the handsome face stayed ..
is she in a dream ? ? / ?
the young man gave her his hand
so she rose ..
and she asked in gratitude : - who are you ? ? / ?
- i am the prayer of your good son for you ... and i believed him on your behalf ..
since you died , he has not stopped praying for you until god took his prayer in the best manner and he permitted him to respond and come here ..........
she felt munker and nakir again ...
you turned and looked at them
and suddenly they say : look .. this is your seat of fire ... and god replaced it with your seat in heaven ..
( ( and a good son is praying for it ) )

< headline > an explanation of how to convert a cassette tape into a cd
< poster > mr. abuein
after entering the era of the cassette , it became virtually impossible for our house to be without these tapes ,
and because of its ease of use and low price , you could find cassettes throughout the house , the car , the office , and everywhere .
some of these tapes are original , recorded in a professional manner and at a high price . however , some are precious home recordings of rare moments , or they might be copies of songs or such .
and now we have entered the digital age , but that does not mean that we eliminate our memories .
it is possible for us to transfer these audio recordings , whether they are on a cassette tape , quarter - inch tape , or on records , and convert them to the mp3 digital format , which enables you to listen to them on the computer and digital disc players , and send them anywhere by electronic mail . "
preparation of equipment and instruments :
in order for you to be able to convert tape recordings into digital format on a compact disc , you first have to set up the computer with the needed equipment and programs so that it is capable to do this work . you have to have available a relatively new computer equipped with a sound card .
and in order to start , you have to connect the cassette device that you have to the computer . this is usually done by using the known connector which is shown in the image here . this connector is available wherever electric equipment accessories are sold . and they are usually inexpensive .
one of the ends of the connector should be plugged into the sound outgoing outlet , line - out , and its other end should be plugged in the sound incoming outlet , line - in , for the sound card present in the computer .
the other thing is the need for a program capable of recording sound through the incoming outlet in the sound card .
one of the best and easy to use programs is musicmatch jukebox . this program has many useful uses , the most important is that you can obtain it for free on the internet .
download and install this program on your computer .
you can visit the site of this program to download it on your equipment . the address of the site is http://www.musicmatch.com/
or from this link , and its size is about 9 megs , click here to download the program .
in order to be able to use the recording anywhere , in addition to providing the greater space that audio uses on the hard disk , it is better to have disk recording equipment available .
disk recording equipment can also read the disks .
these devices use two types of disks , and both types can record sound and record information from the computer programs .
the first are disks that are amenable to one - time recording , and the others are amenable to recording several times .
the second is better but are several times more expensive than the first .
beginning the operation :
the first step :
after you have installed the musicmatch program and connected the stereo to the sound card using the connector mentioned , you can begin recording according to the following steps :
start the musicmatch program .
from the upper menu chose in succession " options " , then " recorder " , then " source " then " in - line . "
now a new window will appear under the window of the first program . and if it does not appear , click on the button rec.
in this window , you will see two words , " album " and " artist , " click on them , then change the name to the new recording that you will be doing .
now press the record button rec in this window , then begin playing the cassette tape on the stereo equipment .
when the recording ends , press the stop button " stop . "
the recording should be complete and placed in the musical library in the program .
you can repeat this process for any subsequent recording .
recordings are automatically saved at a 128 kbps speed , which is more than enough for most tape recordings when high quality is required .
and as soon as the first recording is complete , you should test and confirm the sound level ..
if the recording is too jumbled or soft , you can re - adjust the sound volume from the stereo to the computer or by using the windows program itself .
at the bottom of the screen and on the taskbar you will find the volume icon " in the shape of a megaphone , " click on it twice then adjust the sound by using volume control or " play control . "
select " options " then " properties , " then " recording " and finally " ok . " a window will appear " record control , " select the level of required sound volume .
of course , you must make sure not to use the volume stopping buttons " mute button , " otherwise you will not get anything in the end .
you can use the additional features that are special to recording in this program to control various sound improving elements . to do that , from the menu select " options " then " settings , " then " recorder , " then " advanced . "
from this box , select the sound effect that you wish such as gradual fading " fades " and others .. this produces mp3 recordings resembling professional recordings .
with experience with this program and continued recording , you will become more savvy and the work will be easier and faster to convert old analog recordings into digital recordings .
after you prepare the mp3 recordings , which can total up to 74 minutes , you can begin making a digital audio compact disk .
the second step :
after you selected and collected enough mp3 recordings , you can make them into a list to record them on a compact disk , arranged as you wish .
on the right - hand side of the musicmatch jukebox window you find a list of the recordings .
and in order to copy a song or music piece into this list , you can use the mouse to retrieve any file from the music library into this window .
in general , the recording cd can contain 74 minutes of music . ( musicmatch does not at present handle the new 80 - minute recording compact disk ) .
when you have completed preparing the music pieces that you want recorded on the disk , press the button " cd window " or a new dialog box will appear to you , and it contains several choices for recording the disk .
be sure to select audio ( default ) as the type of disk you want . if you select the last choice , you 'll be able to store more than 600 megabytes on the empty disk , but this type does not work with the regular disk playing equipment .
the status band present at the bottom of the window tells us how much space is left on the empty disk .
you can add or delete from the list of recordings that you plan on storing on the disk by using " test then write cd , " in order to produce a more precise disk .
you may also wish to leave a second or more of empty space between two pieces .
when you are ready for the copying operation , place the blank cd in the disk recording device then press the button " create cd . "

< headline > for god 's sake , read it before deleting it !
< poster > mr. abuein
for god 's sake , read it before deleting it !
look at god 's mercy on you and be ashamed .
look at god 's mercy on you to learn modesty , and look at his kindness and concern for you .
god says in the holy hadith : " people , djinns and we are in great news ,
i create and others are worshipped ,
i give and others are thanked ,
my goodness to the worshippers is revealed and their wickedness is on the rise ,
i bestow loving grace on them and they could not care less for me !
they make themselves hateful to me with sins and they deprive me ,
people who praise me , people who associate with me ; he who wants to associate with me , let him invoke me ,
people who obey me , people who love me ,
people who sin against me , i wo n't let them despair of my mercy . if they repent to me , i will be dear to them , and if they refuse i will be their doctor , i will inflict disasters on them to purify them from their shortcomings . he who comes to me from among them repenting , i will welcome him from afar , and he who turns me down i will call him up close . i will say to him : " where are you going ? "
do you have a lord other than me ?
a good deed with me is equal to ten like it and more , and the wicked deed with me is equal to itself , and i forgive . my glory and my majesty , if they ask for repentance from them , i will forgive them .
publish it , even to one person , in order to help disseminate it and seek the repentance of those who read it !

< headline > newcomer steels limelight from google
< poster > mr. abuein
a thousand new members every day
the new myspace site steels the limelight away from google
www.myspace.com
a new promising star shined recently in the internet world , particularly after it succeeded in creating a name following its wide reception in technical circles .
during only two years of operation , this newcomer has attracted many visitors and users , exceeding all expectations and surpassing the internet giant google with two and a half times the number of users and visitors .
the myspace site has proved itself on the merits to become one of the most important communities on the internet .
the secret behind the success of this site is in its benefiting from previous mistakes and transforming them into strengths . this made it attractive to various young people , particularly students and musicians , by allowing them to fully interact with their friends and providing them in one place most of the services provided by other sites .
some may wonder about the secret behind the success of the site even though it is not the only one in this field , but simply why would its users have to go to another site when all their friends are on the myspace site , particularly when users encourage their friends and insist that they join the site .
it also surpasses its competitors by allowing more customization , which allows the user to add personalization to his page through various background colors , drawings , pictures , video and numerous other features . this characteristic made it outperform its stubborn competitor friendster with the total number of registered users exceeding 54 million users ( at the rate of 180,000 new users daily ) compared to the more than 24 million users of the friendster site .
the new site brings a new tool for chatting with friends and acquaintances . the personal main page has eliminated the need to download electronic mail or instant messaging software , which is the page that the user can use to exchange conversations and personal messages , in addition to the ability of following their teachers and their lectures .
and amidst all this success , the danger of the internet lurches onto teenagers to cast its shadow over the success of the site , particularly since the number of site subscribers who are minor has reached a quarter of the total number of its users .
several school students have been arrested throughout the united states of america after they threatened their fellow students through the site . in addition , the police of one of the states discovered illicit relations with minors who met men pretending deceitfully to be of a younger age on the site , which prompted parents and guardians to forbid their children from using the site , fearing such dangers .
but that did not deter the site owners from forging ahead in developing it and outfitting it with international services to broaden the range of its users , since users from all over the world are coming to it raising the slogan , " we will do everything to keep our users with us . "

< headline > this is how love should be
< poster > yamuslim - owner < msm77777 @ ... >
this is how love should be
main : general : wednesday 9 al-muharram 1427 a.h. - 8 february 2006 a.d. the agenda of islam :
in order for moslems to know the standing of their prophet , god 's prayers and peace be upon him ........... and in order for moslems to know how true love for this great prophet should be ........... the following positions have been taken .
abu bakr , may god be pleased with him ......
and here are these feelings for you designed by the heart of our master abu bakr in words that read ,
our master abu bakr says : we were in the hegira and i was thirsty thirsty [ very thirsty , so i brought diluted yogurt and gave it to the prophet , god 's prayer and peace be upon him , and i said to him : drink , oh prophet of god ,
abu bakr says : so the prophet , god 's prayer and peace be upon him , drank until my thirst was quenched !!
your eyes are not deceiving !!
the words are true and deliberate , this is how abu bakr said them ..
did you taste the beauty of this love ?
it is love of a special kind .. !!
where do we stand with respect to this love ! ?
here it is to you and do not be surprised ,
it is love
.. the love of the prophet is greater than the self ..
on the day of the conquest of mecca , abu qahafa became a moslem [ our master abu bakr 's father ] , and his becoming a moslem was very late , and he had become blind . so our master abu bakr took him to the prophet , god 's prayer and peace be upon him , to announce his becoming a moslem and pledge his allegiance to the prophet , god 's prayer and peace be upon him .
and the prophet , god 's prayer and peace be upon him , said : " oh abu bakr , why did you not leave the old man at his home , and we would have gone to him ? "
abu bakr said : " for you are more worthy to be come to , oh messenger of god . "
and abu qahafa became a moslem .. and our righteous master abu bakr cried ,
so they told him : " this is a day of joy , your father has become a moslem and escaped the fire , so why do you cry ? "
imagine .. what did abu bakr say .. ?
he said : " because i would have liked that the one who pledged allegiance to the prophet now was not my father , but abu taleb , because that would make the prophet more happy , glory to god . " his happiness for the prophet 's happiness is greater than his happiness for his father .
where do we stand with respect to this ?
omar , may god be pleased with him , says : " i was walking with the prophet , god 's prayer and peace be upon him , and some of his companions were with us , and the prophet took my hand and walked . "
omar says : " i found myself saying , ' by god , oh messenger of god , i love you ' . "
so the prophet , god 's prayer and peace be upon him , said to him : " more than your son , omar ? "
i said : " yes . "
he said : " more than your folks , omar ? "
i said : " yes . "
he said : " more than your money , omar ? "
i said : " yes . "
he said : " more than yourself , omar ? "
i said : " no , " [ and see how truthful he is with himself and with the prophet , god 's prayer and peace be upon him ]
so the prophet , god 's prayer and peace be upon him , said : " no , omar . your faith is not complete until i am loved by you more than you love yourself . "
omar says : " so i went out and i reflected , then i came back proclaiming it : by god , oh messenger of god , you are indeed loved by me more than i love myself . "
so the prophet , god 's prayer and peace be upon him , said : " now , omar , now . "
then abdullah bin omar said : " what did you did you do , father , to come back with that ? "
omar said : " son , i went out and i asked myself , who do i need more on judgment day , myself or the messenger of god ?
so i found that i need him more than i need myself ,
and i remembered how i was in the dark and god saved me through him . "
and abdullah bin omar said : " if you were to forget everything about the messenger of god , which is the one thing that you will never forget ? "
omar said : " if i forget what i forgot , i will not forget the day i went to him , saying : " permit me to go out to the minor pilgrimage , oh messenger of god . "
so he said to me : " do not forget us , oh brother , from your good prayers . "
he said a word that made me happy and meant the world to me !
those who only read those words will not feel them ..
they are , by god , feelings that need a heart who loves the prophet , god 's prayer and peace be upon him , to receive them as they are .. fresh and tender .
thawban , may god be pleased with him
the prophet , god 's prayer and peace be upon him , was absent all day from our master thawban , his servant . when he came , thawban said to him : " i missed you , oh messenger of god , " and he cried .
so the prophet , god 's prayer and peace be upon him , said to him : " and this makes you cry ? "
thawban said : " no , oh messenger of god . but i remembered your place in heaven and my place , and i remembered the loneliness . "
and the word of god was revealed , { all who obey god and the messenger are in the company of those on whom the grace of god - from among the prophets , the righteous , the martyrs and the virtuous - the fellowship of those is a good thing } al-nisa sura [ 69 ]
sawad , may god be pleased with him
sawad bin aziyah , on the day of an attack , was someone standing in the middle of the army . the prophet , god 's prayer and peace be upon him , said to the army : " stand .. straight . "
the prophet looks and sees that sawad did not straighten himself .
so the prophet , god 's prayer and peace be upon him , said : " straighten up , sawad . "
sawad then said : " yes , messenger of god . he stood there but did not straighten up . "
then we heard the tree trunk moan at the separation from the prophet , god 's prayer and peace be upon him .
the prophet , god 's prayer and peace be upon him , came to him with his baton and pricked him in the belly .
then sawad said : " you hurt me , oh messenger of god . god has sent you with the truth , so lead me ! "
then when they built a podium for him , he left the tree trunk and went to the podium .
so we find the prophet , god 's prayer and peace be upon him , stepping down from the podium and going back to the tree trunk , and wiping it .
he said : " straighten up , sawad . "
the prophet , god 's prayer and peace be upon him , was preaching at his mosque before the podium was erected next to the tree trunk so that the companions could see him ... and the prophet , god 's prayer and peace be upon him , stood holding the trunk .
what do you think of that love ?
and finally , do not be less than the tree trunk ...
and it said : " oh messenger of god , i think that today is a day of pledging , so i wanted for the last pledge to you that my skin touches yours . "
and the prophet , god 's prayer and peace be upon him , says to it : " would n't you be pleased to be buried right here and be with me in heaven ? "
and the tree trunk went silent ..
and sawad rushed to the prophet 's belly , kissing it . he said : " this is what i wanted . "
and the prophet uncovered his noble belly and said : " take your revenge , oh sawad . "

< headline > why is most of the qur'an addressed to males ?

http://www.islamtoday.net/questions/show_question_content.cfm?id=102303
the title : why is most of the qur'an addressed to males ? !
the responder is dr. hussein al-jizani , member of the teaching staff at the islamic university in the prophet 's city medina .
new classification , date 01/12/1427 , a.h. [ february 11 , 2006 , a.d. ]
the question is that in the qur'an we see - most of the time - that god addresses men , and a similar situation is seen in the prophetic hadith . why ?
the answer is , praise to god and prayers and peace upon the messenger of god , then
this question was actually brought up by the mother of the believers , umm salma - may she pleases god - when she said : " i said to the prophet - prayers and peace upon him - : ' why is it that we are not mentioned in the qur'an as men are mentioned ? ' "
god almighty 's word was then revealed : " moslem men and women , believing men and women .... " ( [ al-ahzab : 35 ] the verse . supported by ahmad ( 26575 ) , and interpreted by al-tabari ( 10/22 ) .
and whereas the holy qu'ran was revealed in the language of the arabs , it came according to their manner of speech where women are subsumed under the language of men , because in arabic the masculine overrides the feminine .
when the man says : " enter , and exit , " he means by that to address all those present , male and females .
it is not proper in the language of the arabs for him to say : " enter men and enter women , and exit men and exit women . "
it is known as well by the sharia 's evidence and interpretations that the mandate of sharia 's judgments is addressed to men and women , for they are all mandated , addressed , held accountable , repented and punished .
this is the uniform foundation and the general rule , which is the association of men and women in all provisions , side by side .
however , there are provisions that are special for men but not women , such as the proscription of gold and silk and the duty of friday and jihad .
just as there are provisions especially for women but not men , such as the veil , caring for the children and such others as required by the nature of each of the two genders . and god is all - knowing .

< headline > a harsh consumption against the prophet 's blasphemer
< poster > mohamed khawas < mmakhawas @ ...
http://www.dorar.net/book_view.asp?book_id=7435 the sunna of god is that moslems cannot seek revenge from he who blasphemes or insults the messenger
sheikh ul - islam ibn tamima , may god have mercy on him said : ( ( in god 's sunna is that if the faithful cannot punish the one among those who harm god and his messenger , then god almighty will avenge his messenger and that is enough for him ) ) .
the story of god annihilating one by one those mockers is known . it was mentioned by the biographers and interpreters , and according to what was said they are a group of people from quraysh : among them , al_walid bin al-maghira , al-aahss bin wa'el , al-aswadan bin al-mutleb , ibn abed yaghuth and al-hareth bin qayss .
and the prophet , god 's prayer and peace be upon him , wrote to xerxes and caesar and both of them did not embrace islam , but caesar honored the letter of the prophet , god 's prayer and peace be upon him , and he honored his messenger . so his reign endured . it is said : " reign lasts in his posterity till today ( 1 ) ,
and xerxes tore the letter of the prophet , god 's prayer and peace be upon him , and he mocked the messenger of god , god 's prayer and peace be upon him , so god killed him a short while later and completely destroyed his reign , and the family of xerxes no longer has a kingdom , and this is so - god is all knowing -
it is commonly said : " the flesh of scholars is poisoned , " so what about the flesh of prophets , god 's prayer and peace be upon them .
in the sahih hadith , the prophet , god 's prayer and peace be upon him , said : " god almighty says : he who has made an enemy of me while supporting me , had dueled me in combat . " so what of those who make enemies of the prophets ?
and he who wages war on the prophet , war shall be waged on him .
and if you were to read the stories of the prophets that are mentioned in the qur'an , you will find that their nations perished when they harmed the prophets and met them with ugly words and actions , and so were the children of israel for they were stricken with lowliness and brought on themselves the wrath of god . they had no supporters in killing the prophets unjustly , in addition to being infidels , as god mentioned in his book .
and perhaps you wo n't find anyone that harmed one of the prophets that did not then repent , otherwise it was inevitable that god struck him with some calamity .
we mentioned what the moslems were experienced in bringing revenge swiftly against infidels if they engaged in blasphemies against the messenger of god , god 's prayer and peace be upon him . similar situations reached us in several instances , and this is a vast area that cannot be covered completely , and it is not our purpose here , but we intended to demonstrate the wisdom of the sharia .
this is similar to the statements of many moslem legal scholars regarding their numerous experiences in surrounding fortresses and cities in the northern shores . when the moslems besieged the tribe of al-asfar in our time , they said : " we were besieging the fortress or the city for a month or more , and it was resisting us until we almost despaired . then its people engaged in blaspheming the messenger of god , god 's prayer and peace be upon him , and besmirching his honor , which made us redouble our efforts in conquest , which took no more than a day or two . the place would be conquered by force and a great butchery would be made there . they said : " even if we would have started to accelerate the conquest , if we heard them besmirching him , our hearts would be filled with wrath for what they said about him . "
thus some our trusted friends told me that the moslems of the people of morocco had experienced with the christians as well , and the sunna of god that his enemies be made to suffer punishment once from him , and once at the hands of his faithful worshippers .
the almighty used to protect him and spare him the harm and insult of people by all means , even in pronunciation ;
in the " al-sahihin " by abu - harira , he said : " the messenger of god , god 's prayer and peace be upon him , said : ' do n't you see how god keeps away from me the blasphemies of quraysh and their curses . they blaspheme with vilification and they curse with vilification , and i am mohammad , ' so god made his name virtuous and raised it above harm , and he deflected this to those who are slanderers , even if the harmful aimed at him . "
and what proves that blaspheming is a crime , in addition to its being infidel and hostile - and if it included that - the prophet , god 's prayer and peace be upon him , used to forgive the deceitful ones who harmed him as shown earlier , when he could have killed them as stated earlier in the discussion about abu bakr and others .
and if blaspheming was simply a response , he ought to be killed like the apostate must be killed , for even as he would be vanquished by blaspheming against the prophet , god 's prayer and peace be upon him , since he is allowed to pardon him .
and the evidence that blaspheming is a deliberate crime , if the dhimmi blasphemes one of the moslems or the allies and he violates the covenant , the blaspheming by this man would a be a crime held against him , for which he deserves to be punished more than just for violating the covenant . so can blaspheming of the messenger of god , god 's prayer and peace be upon him , be less than blaspheming one human being ?
he , may god have mercy on him , said : " to purify the earth from the phenomenon of blaspheming the messenger of god , god 's prayer and peace be upon him , is a duty when possible , because coming from the complete manifestation of the religion of god and the rise of the word of god , and with religion in its entirety belonging to god , whenever blaspheming him appeared and there was no revenge on he who did that , the religion would not be pure and the word of god would not be high . it must also be purified from the fornicators , the polytheists and the bandits whenever possible . contrary to this purification , cleansing it from infidels is not a duty and we can allow the people of the two books to settle on their religion as dhimmis because their acceptance of the dhimmi status makes them committed to the process of the rule of god and his messenger over them . this does not contradict the prevalence of religion and raising the word . however , it is permissible to make a truce with the infidel and exempt him from punishment when it is not possible or when it is in our interest .
the earth must be purified from every crime according to one 's capacity . its perpetrator must be punished according to the sharia . if there is no designated penalty , it is obligatory to have the person killed ; because there is no designated penalty for this crime , because the right of god , his messenger and all the faithful are on the line . this way , the difference between the blasphemer and the infidel will be apparent , which allows the latter to recognize his disbelief , to conceal it and abide by the rule of god and his messenger , unlike the one who expresses the blasphemy .

( 1 ) this was in his time , may god have mercy on him .
the mockery of the messenger of god , god 's prayer and peace be upon him , by the descendants of caesar in our days is good news that their reign and their rule will go away with god 's will .

< headline > mentioning god in the toilet
< poster > kg < ghazyk @ ...
is it permissible for a moslem to recite the qur'an or praise god ( in thought ) in his heart , and without saying it , while he is in the bathroom ?
the answer :
praise be to god
1. praising god is two - fold : praising with one 's tongue such as reciting the qur'an , invocations and prayers which the sharia encourages , and praising in one 's heart by thinking about god almighty 's glory and ability , and thinking about his creatures , all glory and majesty to him , or to elicit the qur'an in one 's heart , which does not have the reward of reciting the qur'an because the reward is dependent on recitation , which can only be done with the tongue . similarly with the prayers , and they are conditioned on being with the tongue and it is not enough to elicit them in one 's heart .
the scholars have distinguished between the two forms of praising , and they said : " it is undesirable to praise god almighty in the bathroom with one 's tongue in glorification of god by mentioning him in that place , " but about praising god in one 's heart they said : " it is not undesirable and it is good . "
and in indication of the difference between the two forms of praising is that the scholars agreed that the ritually impure may elicit the qur'an in his heart , but if he were to recite it with his tongue and utter it , that would be forbidden .
al-nawawi said : " they agreed that if the ritually impure were to handle the qur'an in his heart without moving his tongue , he would not be a reader committing the forbidden impure recitation . " ( al-nawawi 's explanation for the upright moslem , 103/04 . )
ibn al-munther in al-awsat said : " akramah said he does not invoke god with his tongue while in the toilet , but in his heart . " ( al-awsat , 341/1 . )
the permanent committee said : " of the proprieties of islam is for human beings to praise their lord when they want to enter the toilet or the bathroom by saying before entering : ' god , i seek your protection from wickedness and wicked acts , ' and not invoke god after they enter and cease invoking him upon entering . " ( fatwas of the permanent committee , 93/5 . )
sheikh abdel - aziz bin baz said : " praising god in one 's heart is permissible in any time and place , in the bathroom or elsewhere . but it is undesirable in the bathroom and similar places to invoke god with one 's tongue in glorification of almighty god , except naming him when performing the ablutions is allowed only if ablutions cannot be performed outside the bathroom ; for it is an obligation with some of the scholars , and a certain rule with the public . " ( fatwas of sheikh ibn baz , 408/5 . ) and god is all knowing .
