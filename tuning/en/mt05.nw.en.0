erdogan states turkey to reject any pressures to urge it to recognize cyprus
ankara 12-1 ( afp ) - turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan announced today , wednesday , that ankara will reject any pressure by the european union to urge it to recognize cyprus . this comes two weeks before the summit of european union state and government heads who will decide whether or nor membership negotiations with ankara should be opened .
erdogan told " ntv " television station that " the european union cannot address us by imposing new conditions on us with regard to cyprus .
we will discuss this dossier in the course of membership negotiations . "
he added " let me be clear , i cannot sidestep turkey , this is something we cannot accept . "
the european parliament is expected to direct union heads of state and government on december 14 to agree to opening membership negotiations with ankara but with specific conditions .
greece sees ankara 's recognition of cyprus , which is now also a member of the european union , as a " fundamental condition " to the european union giving the green light to opening of membership negotiations with ankara .
turkey still refuses to recognize the republic of cyprus which became a member of the european union last march 1st but it is the only country in the world to recognize the turkish republic of northern cyprus which declared its independence in the northern part of the island .
erdogan also rejected the notion of opening negotiations to create a special partnership between turkey and the european union in place of membership negotiations .
erdogan said on this subject : " this proposal , which we cannot accept , is not appropriate for a serious organization like the european union . "
he added : " we want to start negotiations in the first six months of 2005 or in the second half of the year if this is not possible [ . . . ] but we cannot set the date for starting negotiations in 2006 . "

bogota 12-4 ( afp ) - an agence france - presse correspondent reported that cali cartel boss ( south - west ) gilberto rodriguez orejuela , one of the biggest drug traffickers in the world , was handed over to the united states on friday evening .
orejuela ( 64 years - old ) , who has been incarcerated since 1995 , was taken by armored vehicle from la picota prison to a military base near bogota international airport where he was handed over to american drug enforcement administration officers .
the operation took place with protection by 120 police officers and soldiers in a convoy of cars as a police helicopter circled over the area .
in a statement to agence france - presse , colonel oscar naranjo , in charge of the handover operation , said : " we worked with american drug enforcement teams and handed over rodriguez at the airport . he was taken by plane directly to the united states . "
orejuela appeared calm as he was led to the american plane which will take him to miami , florida .
the authorities said he was allowed to contact family members by phone from the armored vehicle he was in .
he then underwent medical examinations by a police doctor .
colombia 's president alvaro uribe authorized the extradition on november 8th .
the decree , issued by interior and justice minister sabas pretelt , said that colombia agreed to rodriguez orejuela 's extradition on the grounds of charges of " trafficking drugs into the united states , possessing cocaine and money laundering via an international network of fictitious companies . "
the americans made two applications in december for the extradition of rodriguez , known as " the chess player , " and his brother .
florida and new york courts have charged the two brothers with trafficking large amounts of cocaine into the united states between 1990 and july 2002 , as well as laundering millions of dollars and impeding the work of the american justice system .
in florida , the drug enforcement administration refused to comment on colombia 's decision .

american army deserter : the army killed innocent people in iraq
toronto 12-8 ( afp ) - jeremy hinzman , a deserter from the american army and applicant for political asylum in canada , yesterday , tuesday , called a witness , a soldier from the marines , who told the immigration authorities charged with examining hinzman 's file how his unit killed over thirty iraqi civilians in the course of two days .
in his testimony to the immigration and refugee board , which is looking into the political asylum application made by 26 - year - old hinzman who said he deserted so he would not have to kill innocent people , sergeant jimmy massey said " i know we killed innocent people . "
he added that " more than thirty people " were shot by his men at a checkpoint in baghdad in spring 2003 .
he said that soldiers at that time , fearing suicide attacks , would fire at any car that did not stop at the checkpoint after a hand signal or warning shot .
he said that four cars were subject to such intense fire but that when the people inside them were searched , the soldiers found no evidence that they were transporting anything except poor innocents .
he also said that he saw soldiers killing four isolated demonstrators and that they killed more the next day in the course of a surveillance operation in the iraqi capital .
jimmy massey asked " when you do n't know who the enemy is , what do you do ? " following a nervous breakdown and depression , he was released from military service after 12 years in the army .
hinzman , who was with the 82nd airborne division and served in afghanistan , said that he realized after he volunteered in 2001 that he was incapable of killing a human being .
he traveled to canada with his wife and son and applied for political asylum , saying that he would be subject to harassment if he were returned to the united states .
committee for defending saddam hussein : red cross in geneva refrains from meeting committee delegation
amman 12-16 ( afp ) - the committee for defending ousted iraqi president saddam hussein announced that officials at the main headquarters of the international committee of the red cross in geneva refused to meet three of its members yesterday , wednesday .
committee spokesman ziad khasawneh told agence france - presse today , thursday , that " three committee lawyers were to meet with red cross officials in geneva yesterday morning but the latter bowed out shortly before the meeting . "
he said that the three french lawyers traveled to the committee 's headquarters in geneva following an official request by the committee for defending saddam hussein .
he said the aim of the visit was " to find out about the condition of president saddam hussein and other prisoners and detainees , " pointing out that " the pretext used by the committee to refuse to meet the delegation is that it does not want to interfere because of conflicting statements " about the condition of saddam hussein and his detained associates .
prime minister of the interim iraqi government ayad allawi had announced on tuesday in baghdad that the " symbolic " trial of saddam hussein 's former regime would begin next week .
iraqi defense minister hazim al-shalan announced on wednesday that ali hassan majid , nicknamed " chemical ali " and nephew of saddam hussein , would be the first former regime official tried before the court .
the committee for defending the former iraqi president regards the symbolic trial of the former regime as " null and void " because the lawyers for those indicted were not present when they were interviewed .
the first anniversary of the capture of ousted iraqi president coincided with conflicting information about senior members of the former regime being on a hunger strike in their secret prison near baghdad international airport . iraqi lawyers confirm this while the american military denies it .
the defense committee announced on monday that associates of the former iraqi president were on a hunger strike and attributed this to pressure on senior leaders to make them testify against him but it was not able to confirm whether saddam himself was also taking part .
the committee for defending the former iraqi president , whose headquarters are in amman , includes 23 permanent members and the libyan leader 's daughter aisha muammar gaddafi and an american lawyer .
rabat rejects acts of terror in holland being attributed to it
rabat 12-16 ( afp ) - moroccan justice minister , mr. mohamed bouzoubaa , today , thursday , rejected the notion that acts of terror in holland should be attributed to morocco because the persons accused of carrying out attacks of this kind hold dual dutch and moroccan nationality .
the dutch authorities arrested mohamed bouyer ( 26 years old ) who holds dual moroccan and dutch nationality on suspicion of being involved in the killing of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh on november 2nd , along with six other suspects .
in an interview with the newspaper aujourd'hui le maroc , bouzoubaa said the persons involved in terrorist acts in holland " not only have dual moroccan and dutch nationality , some of them were even born in holland . "
the minister added : " this forces me to treat with great caution the moroccanness of terrorist acts committed in holland . "
bouzoubaa said that in spain " some moroccan detainees are clearly suspected of direct or indirect involvement in planning the sixteenth of may events , " alluding to the attacks of may 16 , 2003 attacks which killed 45 people among them 12 suicide bombers in casablanca .
he said : " moroccan terrorists also have links with foreign networks , egyptian and afghan " and that " in fact , this is all to do with the al-qaeda network . "
rabat strongly rejected november 10th statements by the european commissioner for internal market , dutch frits bolkestein , which called on moroccan monarch king mohammed vi to speak out against muslim extremism and state that his country " does not wish to export murderers . "
deputy foreign minister taieb fassi fihri described these statements as " inadmissible judgments on morocco 's alleged responsibility " for the killing of the dutch filmmaker .

he said that " those terrorist countries want to spark strife to extricate themselves from what they have embroiled themselves and the iraqi nation in through what they call the process of democracy . "
al-sadr denied that " the perpetrator could possibly be muslim ; it is the work of the trinity with its associates such as the ones it has installed to keep watch over muslims and over the iraqis . "
elsewhere , al-sadr declared his readiness to protect shiite and sunni mosques equally and said in his statement " i declare my readiness to protect my sunni brothers and their mosques and my shiite brothers and our holy shrines for there is no difference whatsoever between god - fearing brothers for we are all iraqis and it is my duty to protect iraq and its people insofar as it is possible . "
he said : " it is true that self - control is necessary , but only if the perpetrator is not the occupier but if the perpetrator is the occupier and his rulers , then there is no need for self - control . "

tulkarem ( west bank ) 12-29 ( afp ) - the head of the executive committee of the palestinian liberation movement , mahmoud abbas , said today , wednesday , that the separation wall and jewish settlements in the west bank would not give israel security .

"
the gathering was held in the soccer stadium 500 km from the separating wall that is being erected by the jewish state in this area .
the international court of justice in the hague had ruled last july that the wall being erected by israel in the west bank is illegal and called for building to be stopped and the dismantling of what has been built .
israel describes the wall as a " security barrier " while the palestinians describe it as a " racist separating wall " which incorporates a large section of west bank land into israel .

abbas had previously visited tulkarem camp where he met a number of the families of martyrs and with activists in the pro - fatah movement 's al-aqsa brigades which he represents in the elections .

addis ababa 1-2 ( afp ) - over 50,000 people demonstrated today , sunday , in addis ababa to protest against the peace plan proposed by ethiopian prime minister melece zenawi to settle the border dispute with eritrea , reported an agence france - presse correspondent .
these demonstrations were organized by opposition parties who accuse melece zenawi of forfeiting the country 's land .
according to the police 50,000 to 60,000 demonstrators took part in the demonstration , which comes before important general elections to be held next may , while the organizers estimated the number of participants at around 100,000 .
ethiopia and eritrea were involved in a border war from 1998 to 2000 .
after the peace agreement was signed in 2000 in algeria , an independent panel drew up new borders between the two countries , giving eritrea the disputed town of badme .
however , ethiopia rejected this decision in september 2003 and stopped all demarcation operations .
in late november , ethiopia 's prime minister proposed a peace plan in which he agreed " in principle " to demarcation as suggested by the panel but with several " amendments . "
as a result , asmara accused addis ababa of trying to gain time and called for land demarcation operations to start .
benin petros , vice - president of the united and democratic ethiopian front ( opposition ) , said : " we call on public opinion to exert pressure on the government until it withdraws its peace initiative which is in conflict with the interests of the people and nation . "

islamic presidential candidate : palestinian leadership failed in defending palestinian cause
ramallah ( west bank ) 1-3 ( afp ) - one of the candidates for the post of president of the palestinian authority has accused the palestinian leadership of " failing " to defend the " just " palestinian cause over the past many years .
independent islamic candidate said hussein barka ( 48 years ) told agence france - presse that " there has been some failure in presenting our demands , " and added that " we have the worst lawyers for the best case , and the lawyer throughout those years was the palestinian leadership . "
barka lifted the veil off his meeting with the spiritual leader of hamas movement , sheikh ahmed yassin , ten days before his assassination , and said that sheikh yassin " fully approved of hamas taking part in political life and the administration of palestinian society . "
he said : " the truth and reality is that sheikh yassin was fully convinced of political involvement in palestinian society . "
israeli helicopters fired three missiles on sheikh ahmed yassin last march 22nd as he was returning from the mosque after dawn prayers , killing him instantly and killing seven others with him .
before announcing his participation in the elections , barka was chief executive at the palestinian ministry of youth and sports and had organizational relations with the islamic jihad movement . however , he stated that his connection with this movement ended in mid 1991 .
he said that after the announcement of president yasser arafat 's death , he sent hamas movement and islamic jihad a memorandum in which he explained his view of the importance of taking part in the upcoming presidential elections .
he said : " the response to my memorandum was that hamas and islamic jihad announced they would not take part in the elections either by putting forward candidates or by voting and would not support anyone . "
after that , barka decided to put himself forward for the presidential elections and said that he was successful in the elections even before they were held through what he described as " relative support among the palestinians . "
he expects to have a future role in the islamic movement in the palestinian territories if he is not successful in the elections .

european commission opens discussion on european policy on economic migration
strasbourg 1-11 ( afp ) - today , tuesday , the european commission launched a consultation process on the possibility of putting in place a new policy on economic migration to the european union with the aim of covering the expected workforce shortage as european society ages .
these consultations will be in the form of a " green book " in which member states , social partners and non - government organizations will put their suggestions and views by april 15 to allow the commission to propose a working plan before the end of the year .
the commission said that between " 2010 and 2030 , at the current rate of immigration , the workforce will fall by 20 million workers in the 25 union states . "
it added that " a higher rate of immigration may become necessary to fill the needs of the european market . "
however , the commission stressed that these policies would never decide the number of workers allowed to enter each country , as this would be a matter for national administrations , in accordance with the european constitution project .
however , the commission said that the decision to allow foreigners to enter a union country would affect other union countries because of the freedom of travel in the shengen zone and because of the right to benefit from the services of other countries , etc.
the commission also suggested creating common standards to allow immigration , with the greatest possible harmony in agreement with preferences of member states .
european commissioner for justice , freedom and security franco frattini sees that " member states , the european parliament , trade unions , companies and the many concerned parties have different views on this matter . "
italy and spain support the open - door idea to higher immigration while germany , which has a high unemployment rate , opposes it .
the european commission had put forward a draft proposal to unify entry and residency conditions in the european union for this type of legal immigrant , but it was not successful .
sunni party withdraws from elections because of arrest of secretary - general by american army
baghdad 1-12 ( afp ) - the national front for iraqi unity , led by sheikh hassan zaidan khalaf al-lahibi announced today , wednesday , that it has decided to withdraw from the general elections , to be held on the thirtieth of this january , because american forces arrested its secretary - general late last month .
abdulsami khalil jabbara al-ubaidi , deputy secretary - general , said in a press conference held at babel hotel in central baghdad that " the decision to withdraw was made because of the arrest of the front 's secretary - general sheikh hassan zaidan khalaf al-lahibi last december 31 by american forces . "
he added : " it would seem that the elections are not taken seriously by the american side and that there is no immunity for any official from any political party with an election list which he heads himself . "
al-ubaidi said that " in addition to this reason , there is a whole set of reasons which caused us to make the decision to withdraw " and referred in particular to " the deteriorating security situation in most of the country . "
he said " we had previously asked for the elections to be postponed by six months but our request was not granted . "
al-ubaidi said his party " sent a copy of the decision to withdraw in a memorandum to the independent electoral high commission . "
on a question about whether the decision to withdraw was influenced by the decision of other sunni parties to boycott the elections or withdraw from them , al-ubaidi said " this decision was made in isolation and is not influenced by any third party . "
the secretary - general of the national front for iraqi unity , hassan zaidan khalaf al-lahibi ( 58 years ) , was head of the iraqi military academy which includes four military colleges among them the engineering college . he held several military posts within the former iraqi regime and was given the rank of general in 1996 .
the national front for iraqi unity gained the electoral high commission 's approval as a political entity with a number of 67 and the election list number for the front was 166 , and it had intended to put forward 216 candidates for the national assembly elections .
london gives up principle of joint sovereignty over gibraltar " forever "
madrid 1-12 ( afp ) - the chief minister of gibraltar , peter caruana , announced today wednesday in cadiz that london has given up " forever " the principle of joint sovereignty by spain and britain over this region .
caruana said in a press conference held in cadiz ( andalusia ) that britain has given up " forever " the principle of joint sovereignty with spain because this was " bad for gibraltar and for spain . "
he said gibraltar , like spain , supported the end of colonialism in this region .
however , he said that " we understand that it is necessary to implement autonomous rule whereas spain wants the region to be re - integrated into spain . "
caruana maintained that british and spanish authorities were aware that their attempts to resolve the issue through joint rule of gibraltar was " doomed to failure because this violates the dignity of gibraltar 's inhabitants . "
in november 2002 , 98.97% of gibraltar 's 20,500 electorate said in a survey that they wish to remain british .
on december 17 , spain , britain and gibraltar announced they were holding a " forum for dialogue on gibraltar " during which madrid agreed for the first time that gibraltar 's government should have the power to make decisions in the same way as london and madrid .
however , spain 's prime minister , jose luis rodriguez zapatero , announced on december 18 that madrid would maintain its demand for sovereignty over gibraltar .
he said this demand was " an issue spain will not relinquish .
this is a basic principle . "
the british colony of gibraltar , covering an area of six square kilometers to the south of spain , is located at the entrance to a strait which links the atlantic ocean with the mediterranean sea .
spain gave it up to britain in 1713 in the utrecht treaty .

iran denies information concerning presence of american commando groups in iran
tehran 1-19 ( afp ) - a top iranian official has denied press information which describes american commando groups infiltrating iran to identify nuclear sites as possible targets for air raids , said iranian newspapers today wednesday .
the spokesman for the supreme national security council , ali aga mohamedi , said " it would not be possible for any american commando groups to enter iran this easily for espionage purposes and it would be naive to believe such an idea . "
he added " we know our borders . "
mohamedi criticized information in the american new yorker magazine , saying it was part of a " psychological campaign " against the islamic republic .
the new yorker wrote in its latest issue that american commando groups have been carrying out secret reconnaissance missions in iran since summer 2004 in search of likely nuclear and chemical targets .
in spite of the american defense department ( pentagon ) denying this information , its publication led to increased speculation about possible american military action to stop iranian nuclear activities .
the tone of these speculations increased when american president george bush announced on monday in an interview with american television network nbc that he does not rule out military action against iran .
bush said " i hope we can resolve this problem diplomatically , but i will never rule out any option . "
ali aga mohamedi said the new yorker information " is not worthy of discussion . "
he repeated that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful and that iran is not trying to acquire an atomic bomb as the united states claims .
he added " we do not possess nuclear weapons and the international atomic energy agency has inspected iranian installations . "
former iranian president hashimi rafsanjani , who is still an active figure in the iranian regime , on tuesday warned the united states against any military action against iran .
the iranian news agency reported rafsanjani as saying that " threats from our external enemies do not frighten us and they know perfectly well that iran is an historic islamic state with a noble history ; it is not a suitable place for adventures . "

general wilmhelmsen said in a press conference today , wednesday , that the success of the mission he is in charge of in the nuba mountains ( one of the three areas covered by the peace deal signed on january 9 in nairobi between khartoum and southern rebels ) depends on good cooperation between former fighters .
he said that the mechanisms implemented in the nuba mountains could be used elsewhere in sudan after security is established in all regions .
he added that there had been no clashes between armed forces in the nuba mountains since the ceasefire was implemented and said that the lessons learned from this experiment would be presented to the united nations so that they could be used in other areas .
general wilmhelmsen said the success of the ceasefire has led to a doubling of the number of inhabitants in the area since 2002 , from 720,000 to 1.5 million .
he said that life had almost returned to normal , in spite of the mines laid during the war .
on january 5 , the sudan news agency reported that the united nations had asked for a 100 - day period to take over from the joint military committee in the nuba mountains .

dalian has 71 projects with british investment , mainly in the area of transformation technology , trade and the services industry .
contractual investments are estimated at around 430 million us dollars and actual investments at around 158 million us dollars .

the committee said " we are not accusing the united states or any other countries , but we are expressing our solidarity with him . "
the committee is expected to look into matters related to the union 's budget in its session today , tuesday .
the secretary - general 's son kojo annan is being investigated on corruption charges .
corruption rumors appeared in january when an iraqi newspaper published a list of about 270 prominent personalities from at least 46 countries and said they received oil money from saddam 's regime .
it was said that the list included benon sevan , one of the united nations official responsible for the program , but he vehemently denied this charge .

annan opened an internal investigation in february but cancelled it in march in preparation for a broader , independent investigation .
the oil - for - food program was started in december 1996 to allow iraq to export 69.5 billion us dollars worth of oil .
the united nations supervised the sale of iraqi oil and iraq 's purchase of humanitarian supplies . the program was terminated last november .

sources : marwan al-barghouthi 's candidacy for presidential elections illegal
gaza december 11 / xinhua / palestinian sources close to the fatah movement said today , saturday , that the candidacy of marwan al-barghouthi , the movement 's secretary - general in the west bank who is being held in israeli prisons , is not legal .
the sources , who wished to remain anonymous , said putting forward al-barghouthi , who is serving five life sentences in israel , as a candidate is a " breach one of the terms of palestinian authority presidential election law . "
they added that " the law requires that anyone putting themselves forward as a candidate for the palestinian presidency resign from any post held and that this resignation must be given in writing to the general elections committee , and this especially if they are members of public institutions , judges or security officers and this applies to members of the palestinian legislative council . "
the sources said that " hassan kharisha , the legislative council 's charge d'affaires , had to withdraw from the presidential elections after he was informed by committee members that he had to choose between continuing to be a member of the legislative council or resigning in order to take part in the elections , as stipulated by palestinian law . "
the sources said that " the same applies to al-barghouthi who put himself forward as a candidate without handing in his resignation from the legislative council which constitutes a legal breach that precludes him from being a candidate in these elections . "
the sources said that item 10 concerning the candidacy for post of president stipulates that " the terms of item 14 of this law are applicable to candidates for the post of president but the president of the palestinian authority is exempt from this . "

comment : strange reference to " chinese threat " in japanese defense program
tokyo december 11 / xinhua / the japanese government today , friday , unveiled a ten - year defense program which unjustifiably describes china as a potential threat , along with the democratic people 's republic of korea .
while democratic korea has no diplomatic relations with tokyo , china is a country with which japan has signed a peace treaty and has very close economic ties .
in spite of the diplomacy of the wording , a summary of the japanese defense program said china and democratic korea are the only two neighbors that pose a threat to it .
the document released by the japanese government on friday said " it is necessary to monitor china 's nuclear and ballistic missile programs , its modernization of the navy and air forces and its attempts to expand naval activities . "
china and japan normalized their relations 32 years ago .
in addition to the peace and friendship treaty signed six years later , the two countries agreed to update their relations in order to make this a partnership in 1998 .
over the past three decades , trade between them has increased by 130 times and is expected to reach 150 million us dollars this year .
china may become japan 's largest trading partner in the very near future .
the total value of japanese investments in china amounts to 46 billion dollars .
the great complementarity between the economies of these two states has made long - term friendship and peace between china and japan all the more important , not only for the two countries , but also for peace and prosperity in east asia and the world in general .
in this context , it is hard to understand why japan considers china a source of threat .
hosoda hiroyuki , japan 's chief cabinet secretary , tried to play down the " china threat " issue .
he told reporters today , friday , that the new defense program did not refer to china as a threat but as a country that deserves japanese attention in the area of security .
comment : strange reference to " chinese threat " in japanese defense program / first and last addition /
however , his explanation did not convince even the japanese media which said this was the first time the japanese defense program has mentioned a " chinese threat " albeit in an indirect manner .
the japanese government 's move to expose the " chinese threat " goes against the two peoples ' aspirations for permanent peace and friendship .
the chinese foreign ministry 's spokeswoman , zhang zhe qiyue , said that china has expressed its " strong dissatisfaction " with the japanese move and said that " it is totally unjustified and extremely irresponsible . "
it is well - known that the chinese people are peace - loving .
a stronger china will not be a threat to any other country . to the contrary , it contributes constructively to the development of its neighbors and to regional and international stability and prosperity .
china hopes japan will take into consideration its asian neighbors ' concerns and strive to be cautious in military and security policies .
japan must commit to the path of peace and contribute to regional peace and development .
it should be noted that japan appears to be following the united states in security strategy .
japan might be changing its defense priorities to counter - terrorism after the september 11 attacks and strengthening its defense capacity against what it calls the " democratic korea threat . "
however , its unbelievable enthusiasm for a missile defense system in cooperation with the united states reveals its true intentions .
it is extremely unconvincing at all that such a missile defense system is designed for the above - mentioned purposes only .

spokesman : united states will not reduce military presence in afghanistan
kabul december 13 / xinhua / the united states denied reports today , monday , concerning the likelihood of cutting its troops in afghanistan .
mark mccann , allied spokesman , told journalists here " we are here to help afghanistan drive out the terrorist threat and secure a stable and peaceful future .
we intend to stay here until we finish our job . "
on the basis of previous news , general david barno , commander - in - chief of the allied forces led by the united states , anticipated the pentagon cutting its troops once the current peace mission is accomplished .
according to the american army , remnants of the taliban regime , which is waging gang warfare against the afghan government led by karzai and his foreign supporters , have made contact with afghan and allied officials in order to reach reconciliation with the authorities and bolster the peace process .
the spokesman said " during military missions , leaders assess their strengths and capabilities to make sure they have the necessary capability and when we see that the level of threat has fallen , we will review the strength of our forces and adjust them accordingly . "
he added " general david barno 's comment simply describes this process and is not an attempt to predict a particular outcome .
the american commander said he was in agreement with the opinion that there are still elements intent on destruction and and who wish to disrupt the country 's stability .
allied forces , controlled by the united states , have been on the increase constantly since they were deployed in afghanistan three years ago , after the fall of the taliban in 2001 .
the afghan government , as well as the american administration , announced an amnesty for taliban militia but the movement 's spokesman abdullatif hakimi turned down the offer and described it as a " ploy to divide the militia " and pledged to fight until the end .

turkish prime minister calls for cyprus issue to be settled
ankara december 28 / xinhua / turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan called today , tuesday , for vigorous measures to be taken in order to resolve the cyprus issue .
erdogan told the general assembly before it voted on the 2005 draft budget that " turkey cannot protect its interests in cyprus if it insists on intractable solutions and if it continues to be negative and acts with a self - defense strategy . "

the european union summit has decided to start membership talks with turkey on october 3 , 2005 .
however , given the big cultural , economic and educational gap between turkey and the european union , turkey faces a tough battle to join the bloc comprised of 25 countries .

chinese scientists discover dinosaur - eating mammal
beijing january 13 / xinhua / according to a report published today , thursday , chinese scientists have discovered a fossilized dinosaur - eating mammal in the province of liaoning in northeast china .
the discovery made by hu yao ming , wang yuan ching and li chuan kui , all from the paleontology and paleoanthropology institute at the chinese academy of sciences , and ming jin from the museum of nature in new york , was published in a paper in the british journal nature .
the fossilized mammal lived in the middle era .
this discovery reveals that some large - sized mammals which lived in that era may have been carnivorous and brave enough to compete with dinosaurs for food and living space .
li said the undigested bones , including teeth and limbs , of a small dinosaur were found in its stomach .
he added that unbroken joints mean the mammal tore apart and devoured its prey , without biting or chewing .
he said that prior to this latest discovery , most scientists assumed that mammals in the middle era were fairly small and active at night .
it was assumed that they fed on insects and would not dare to approach dinosaurs .
he said the recent discoveries challenge this view , held for a long time , and prove that some primitive mammals were larger than medium - sized dinosaurs .
scientists had previously believed that they ate small animals and came out in broad daylight .
on the basis of this analysis , the dinosaur devoured was one - third of the size of the mammal .

it is complicated work and may take a long time . "
alexeyev 's comment came on the eve of japanese foreign minister nobutaka machimura 's visit to moscow which is expected to pave the way for russian president vladimir putin 's planned trip to japan later this year .
russia and japan have yet to sign a peace treaty to end wartime hostilities because of a continuing dispute over four islands near northern japan annexed by the soviet union in the final days of world war ii .
russia recently offered to give japan back two of the islands , known as the southern kuriles in russia and as the northern territories in japan , after the peace treaty is signed , citing a joint declaration signed in 1956 between the soviet union and japan .
japan asked for all four islands , which stretch from northern japan to the tip of the russian kamshatka peninsula in the far east , to be given back , saying that this was a preface to signing the peace treaty .
during machimura 's visit to moscow , the two sides are expected to discuss the half - century - old regional dispute and preparations for putin 's visit to japan , in addition to joint economic cooperation , according to itar - tass news agency .
it is expected that other issues will be discussed including the democratic people 's republic of korea and iraq .
