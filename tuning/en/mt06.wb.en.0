< headline > why do we muslims rant about human rights for muslim minorities in the west yet refuse to apply these to christians in countries in which we are the majority ?
< poster > by doctor yusra mustapha , a muslim writer but against terrorism
for our muslim governments , who take the religion of islam as the basis for their legislation , not to like human rights , especially the rights of religious minorities to practice their rituals , this is understandable . but for human rights to be regarded with suspicion by the upper classes and working classes outside the governmental sphere , this is a matter that requires reflection and an explanation .
we have seen , over the past years , that one of the major challenges for human rights and women 's rights groups is assimilating human rights into a culture that still does not want to recognize the principles of human rights and their universality .
as we know , the principal pillar on which the rejection of human rights is based is cultural specificity , that discourse which argues that our societies have different values in terms of human rights values because the latter are western values in origin and nature .
in any case , the problem of spreading human rights culture does not result from restrictions by the state alone . alongside this is a general ethos fed by the discourse of cultural specificity aimed at stripping universal human rights ' values of their legitimacy .
in truth , this cultural rejection , which non - governmental political and ideological forces contribute to keeping alive , is a fact that cannot be ignored . rather than ignoring it , it would be better look for the causes .
i think that the principles of human rights find no resonance in our societies not because they are foreign to us , but perhaps because they are foreign to a legal and political order with a selective approach to human rights and double standards .
anyone interested in the matter will not be unaware that human rights are not rejected as a whole but in parts . group rights for example are acceptable , as are political rights , even if they bother the government but they are listened to by opposition forces , including those that promote the discourse of cultural specificity .
as for personal rights , these are the real problem ; they are what give rise to the discourse of cultural specificity , not just by governments but also by political and ideological forces that stand shoulder to shoulder with the authorities to create a public opinion that is opposed to universal human rights in the name of specificity .
when we talk about the right to develop , we feel a group comfort and accuse the western other of exploiting us and when we talk about the right to form parties , the opposition responds and the government is angered .
but when it comes to freedom of thought or belief or personal rights for women , the discourse of cultural specificity comes to the fore to strip human rights of their legitimacy by seeing them as western values . consequently , the issue of cultural specificity is not used to confront human rights in a general manner but in a partial , selective manner , especially when the matter concerns fundamentally personal rights and freedom .
from this point , if we want to examine the lack of cultural legitimacy we accord the principles of human rights in our societies , we have to start from our cultural and political position on personal rights .
in other words , we have to start at the beginning by first questioning how legitimate personal rights are before we start talking about the legitimacy of human rights .
a respected article by the german philosopher habermas entitled " ascribing legitimacy by means of human rights " in which he says , " new laws fundamentally come about from the starting point of personal rights " .
these rights give a law - abiding person legal scope to act according to his personal priorities .
in this way , these rights absolve the person who holds the rights , in a very modified manner , from any other kind of ethical - moral orders or recommendations .
in any case , no - one is legally required , within the limits allowed by law , to openly show his work .
habermas points out that personal freedoms have been brought into the framework of modern law and as such , this is different from traditional legal systems . this reinforces hobbes ' principle which states : everything is allowed that is not expressly prohibited and this is how law differs from morality .
the separation of law from morality in modern law is an important issue , not because we like the law and hate morality but because this is the modern historical logic for the principle of the rule of law .
this separation is what has historically allowed the existence of essentially legal entities on the basis of the concept of personal rights , as opposed to conventional orders in which people are essentially moral beings that are formed and disciplined in accordance with moral systems based on religion or customs and conventions or even modern political ideologies .
while contemporary law is founded on the principle of personal rights , moral discourse is based on a collective , comprehensive concept of rights and duties .
in truth , when the matter concerns the individual in our societies , we find ourselves living in three dimensions : in one aspect , we are lawful entities as a result of historical progress which we do not reject , because laws rule us even if such laws conflict with general and personal rights .
a second aspect is that sections of civil law are interwoven with the religious - moral - terrorist as a model for laws relating to civil status or freedom of thought or belief or the religious rights of minorities .
a third aspect is that we as people are largely subject in our lives to purely moral rules which have an authority that the law does not have , especially when the matter relates to personal rights .
yet with even this degree of freedom unfettered by the law , morality appears and curbs it , unlike law .
this is similar to the collective religious discourse , or what is endorsed in the name of customs and traditions , which comes in to impose new patterns of life within a framework of a system of rules and non - judicial moral restrictions by means of which individuals organize their lives in their capacity as moral beings .
some might think that certain legal tenets are in constant conflict with moral tenets but this is far from being correct .
law and morality can meet in a positive manner when both law and morals criminalize crimes , killing and theft for example .
but they also meet in a negative way to restrict personal freedoms and rights .
in our societies in particular , law regresses into its oppressive forms and leaves the arena to moral laws , not because they rival it but because these laws play a utilitarian role in the interest of authority , in other words the role of social control , especially in the area of personal rights and freedoms .
in this controlling context , an alliance occurs between three authorities : political authority , religious authority and the authority of customs and traditions .
what cannot be controlled by law can be controlled by morality and an individual will be punished , even if he has not broken the law .
what is noticeable is that this process of control is dependent on moral punishment , which can progress to violence , where individuals are categorized not on the basis of abiding or not abiding by the law but on the basis of a moral trait in the manner of what is pure and impure in the primitive sense .
the religious discourse addressed to women depends of a kind of moral grading such as saying the hijab equals chastity and purity and she who does not wear the hijab is punished culturally and socially in the sense that she has lost her legitimacy in terms of chastity and purity .
we also see this kind of grading in political ideologies where he hear the term " honorable citizens " , suggesting that the person who does not follow the political agenda is only a citizen and if he objects , he may be deemed to be a dishonorable citizen .
the language of chastity and purity and honor involve a type of non - judicial punishment of moral entities .
this highlights the dilemma of the legitimacy of human rights because the language of human rights is a legal language in principle , in other words it is designed to speak to lawful entities that live within a political and legal order based on citizenship which recognizes the personal rights of individuals and protects them .
however , the problem , as pointed out earlier , is that the lawful entity itself has no cultural legitimacy and is replaced by an entity that is moral in essence .
on the basis of this , the discourse of human rights enters into an area that is foreign to its legal language and terms and is treated in a selective manner where the collective is accepted and the personal is rejected .
the legitimacy of human rights cannot be instituted until there is collective recognition that they are legitimate .
this recognition will not come as long as there are authorities that fear human rights and people who do not speak the language of law , which is the language of human rights , but rather with the language of morality which is the language of political and religious authority and the authority of customs and traditions .
this is where the importance of defending the issue of citizenship comes in , not because it is a matter of tolerance and co - existence but because it is fundamentally a matter of civil rights and giving consideration to the lawful entity based on personal rights and freedom .

and cows ... make mistakes !!
badriya al-abd al-rahman 2/1/1427 2/1/2006
i know that my topic is the hottest topic on the islamic scene these days ...
it might seem to a lot of you that it is repetitive of me to talk about the danish foolishness that has rallied muslim feelings across the world ... and how we were able to read and calm a situation that presaged undesirable results .
what 's the story ?
how can we explain this highly exceptional behavior ?
can we interpret it as a sudden awakening of religious fanaticism in the century of tolerance and non - bigotry ? !!
or is it a more abrupt awakening of non - religious fanaticism against religion and faiths and religious icons ? !
what is most surprising is that this is happening in a quiet , peaceful country that has noticeably abstained from participating in international decisions ... yet it is perhaps this political activity ( and " untouchableness " ) and geographical distance from the sites of cultural and ideological conflict , especially with muslims and with other civilizations in general , that make it a controversial issue ,
that there should be an initiative ( although exceptional ) by a magazine to provoke the followers of the muslim religion that millions worldwide believe in .
what is worse is that this provocation should take place not out of goodwill or in order to bring about a dialog with the other ... but to create an islam ( with medals ) on which accusations and previously defined stereotypical images of our religion are hung ...
this whole scene showed extremely shocking danish foolishness which i do n't think history will gloss over easily ... and i do n't think the land of cows and milk with its image of great kindness and naivety needed to flex its muscles - when it wanted to flex them - by provoking islamists and muslims of all persuasions ...
why only islam ... ?
and using the supreme symbol of this religion , its noble prophet may god 's peace be upon him ... describing it as the religion of bombs and death ... categorically ... more categorically than categorically ... because the role of the cartoons in the newspaper is to implant the image of a true muslim reality that only idiots argue about ... !
so it is with this simplicity that the long history of a major religion is reduced to a cartoon depiction that is offensive to us alone , and not to other religions and ideological movements in the world in whose name atrocities and crimes against the whole world were committed ... so that islam alone remains on the death list ...
this is how what is sacrosanct is debased and religious sensibilities are attacked beyond the red line , and cross it by hundreds of meters without the slightest shame or logic ... as though religion is now a product or merchandise of no importance in terms of what it symbolizes and does , and what it brings about in the souls of its believers ....
in brief , a lack of manners and rudeness in the cultural code ... in the political code ... in all codes ... nothing can explain this foolishness except that it is a lack of manners which denmark did not expect to result in any foolish action against it ... because it was quite simply being ( impious and oppressive ) .
damn this miserable image ... not only because it is wrong and ugly ... but because it also awakens issues that have been fomenting for centuries in the western mind against islamists ... islamists of death and the sword and horses and slitting throats in god 's name ... no more
residues that have found those who stir them up to muddy the relative harmony in which muslims in the west live , and in denmark in particular specifically because of fanatics ( of whatever ideological type ) who are not aware of the dangers of what they are doing ...
what has denmark done to itself for god 's sake ? !
and how can it hope to gain our respect after all that has happened ?
how can it protect its citizens in islamic countries , and everywhere , from the fierce anger of muslims ? !
just questions , i do n't know if they have gone through or are going through the minds of the danes and public opinion and decision - makers ... or is that mind still preoccupied with milking its cows and making its butter without being conscious of the enormity of the crisis it has been landed in by a magazine team that has now become every dane in the mind of every muslim !
we boycott ... so that we can be ... !
calls via text messages and email to boycott danish products and defame them are a healthy and good manifestation and i fully support this ...
since the boycott on american and israeli goods , the muslim arab mind has leapt to create its " say no " areas which are heavy and difficult at times ... yet in a beautiful and admirable way , even though we might disagree with it .
the international mind must understand that the muslim is no longer one of a group of countries mainly from the third world ( when you are absent and they cannot be ordered because they are witnesses ) ... it is now educated , someone aware of his or her cultural background which is the muslim religion with its different sects or varied commitment to its religious teachings ...
what is important is that it now knows how to say " no " in a loud and cultured voice , in a manner that expresses its unease with the arrogance of the abuse which the westerners use against the arabs who need them and resort to them and line up in queues to get entry visas and work there ...
western arrogance which has a long history and has lasted and has finally come to debase what is sacrosanct ... and what is sacrosanct is a huge red line in any culture which every person has the right to protest against if it is debased through sarcasm and humiliation .
when i say this , i know that my boycotting and your boycotting will not damage or diminish danish butter or its widespread reputation ... nor its stupid cows ... but we do it for ourselves ... so that we do n't lose the only simple " no " we have at the moment which fills our mouths ...
let us say : " we are here , we live on this planet with all our problems and crises ... we can live side by side and we deserve respect ... ... we possess the right to express ourselves and to reject , even though we hate having to do this ... "
to stop more trouble - making and hatred being pumped into the sea of hatred that our pitiful planet is rolling in ... i hope that denmark will make a sweeping and deep - felt apology to muslim sensibilities and alleviate the extent of the crisis ...
and not wait for what is in the muslim heart to be expunged in one go with one apology ... because the extent of the shock was great and eliminating it will be no easy matter ...
because if that apology is not made , then we will spend our whole lives replaying this piece ... regurgitating hatred ... and raising our children and our children will raise their children to believe that denmark and satan are brothers and what applies to one applies to the other ...
if this apology is not made then the fire of hatred will carry on burning ... and perhaps denmark will be surprised by a deed that results because the feelings of muslims were provoked . it may find a good application of the hardened terrorist with his ( explosive ) turban in its land and amongst its beautiful castles and its ugly cows .
perhaps denmark will lose all its beauty and naivety because of its long tongue ...
perhaps its cows have chattered away more stupidly than usual ...
perhaps we have only a few days before we see something we would not have wished upon denmark before ...
perhaps everything will happen ( here or there )
how i hate ( perhaps ) in this context ... may god prevent any evil , perhaps ... !!!

negative and positive self - programming

negative and positive self - programming ...
most people are programmed from a young age to behave , speak or think in a specific negative way . this grows with them until they become prisoners of what is called " negative programming " which stops them achieving many things in this life .
we find many of them saying " i have a weak personality . i ca n't stop smoking . i 'm bad at dictations . i. .. "
we find they have acquired this negativity from the family , school or friends or all of these together .
but can this negative programming be changed and transformed into positive programming ? the answer is yes ... a thousand times yes . but why is this necessary ???
we need to program ourselves positively to be happy and successful , to live a good life , to realize our dreams and goals . especially as we are muslims and we have a task and an aim that we must achieve in order to worship god almighty and realize the vicegerency that god has given us on this earth .
before we start the program to change negative programming , we must agree on a number of matters which are :
you have to decide deep inside yourself that you want to change . your decision is what will light the way to transforming negativity into positivity .
repeat the actions and affirmations you are about to learn and make them part of your life .
now , the first method in positive programming is :
talking to yourself :
have you seen someone talking to themselves loudly as they walk along , gesticulating and murmuring and maybe swearing and cursing . of course we do n't want you to copy this behavior .
or have you ever had a fierce argument with another person and , after the person leaves , the argument goes round in your mind again so that you imagine the argument again and start changing the words and expressions around and saying to yourself why did n't i say this or that ...
did you ever attend a lecture or talk and talked to yourself and said " i could n't make a speech like that " or " how could i stand up in front of all those people " or you say " i could never stand up in front of people to give a speech or a lecture . "
all this talk and discussion with the self negatively programs a person and could lead to unhealthy actions .
luckily you and i and anyone have the ability to change our attitude to how we talk to ourselves and we can change negative programming and replace it with a new programming that gives us power .
one self - help guru says , " we can change our past and our future at every moment by reprogramming our present . "
so , from now on , we have to watch and be aware of the internal dialogue we have with ourselves .
it has been said ,
watch your thoughts because they will become actions .
watch your actions because they will become habits .
watch your habits because they will become traits ...
watch your traits because they will decide you fate .
i want clarify a few scientific facts about the human mind , and to focus in particular on the subconscious mind .
the subconscious mind does not rationalize things in the same way as the conscious mind because it quite simply stores information and repeats it whenever it is called up from where it is stored .
if a message is programmed in the mind for a long time and repeated constantly , for example if you always say in every situation ... " i 'm very shy , i 'm very shy " , " i 'm bad - tempered " or " i ca n't play sports " , " i ca n't stop smoking " and so on , then such messages become embedded and stay deep within the subconscious mind and ca n't be changed . but they can be replaced by other healthy and positive programming .
another fact is that the subconscious mind has strange behavior we 're do n't notice . so for example if i say this sentence to you , " do not think of a black horse " , can you do that and stop your mind from thinking about it . of course not , because you have most likely started to think of a black horse .
why ??
your mind has cancelled out the word " not " and retained the rest of the sentence which is : think of a black horse .
so is it possible to exploit this strange behavior of the mind ?
let 's now give you a summary and let doctor ibrahim al-faqi tell us , as he mentions in his book the power of self - control : rules and basic program for positive self - programming :
he says :
here are the five rules for programming the subconscious :
- your message must be clear and definite .
- your message must be positive ( such as i am strong , i am healthy , i can stop ... )
- your message must be in the present tense ( for example , do n't say " i will be stronger " but say " i am strong " )
- your message must be accompanied by a strong belief in its content so that the subconscious mind accepts it and programs it
- the message must be repeated several times to be completely programmed .
here 's the plan so that your dialogue with yourself has positive power :
write at least five self - messages with a negative effect on you such as :
i 'm shy , i ca n't stop smoking , my memory is poor , i ca n't speak in public , i 'm bad - tempered , then tear up the paper you wrote the negative messages on and throw it away .
write five positive self - messages which give you strength and always start with the word " i " such as :
" i can stop smoking " , " i like talking to people " , " i have a good memory "
" i am an excellent person " , " i am active and have a lot of energy " .
write your positive message in a small diary and keep it with you at all times .
now take a deep breath and read the messages one after the other till you memorize them .
start again with the first message and take a deep breath , get rid of any tension in your body , read the first message 10 times with emotion , close your eyes and imagine yourself in your new form then open your eyes .
starting from today , be careful about what you say to yourself and be careful what you say to others and be careful about what others say to you . if you notice any negative message , cancel it out by saying " cancel " and replace it with a different , positive message .
make sure you have strength and can be and can possess and can do whatever you want simply by defining exactly what it is you want and moving in that direction with all your strength . jim ron talked about this in his book " permanent happiness " : " repetition is the basis of skills "
this is why you must have confidence in what you say and also repear positive messages to yourself for you are the master of your mind and the captain of your ship ... you control your life and you can transform your life into a limitless happy , healthy and successful experience .
always remember :
live each moment as though it is the last moment in your life .
live in faith , live in hope .
live in love , live in challenge .
value how precious your life is .
( adapted from the book the power of self - control by dr ibrahim al-faqi )
finally , i wish you luck , forgiveness and mercy .
amen
your brother in god

dandruff ... causes and treatment
i believe this is a very common problem which everyone suffers from at one point or another in their life
at one time , it was believed that dandruff was caused by the rapid growth of hair cells on the scalp but this idea has been found to be wrong .
it has recently been discovered that dandruff is caused by a type of yeast called pityrosporum ovale
and the problem appears as a result of poor circulation in the scalp ,
anxiety
using hot water to wash hair
as well as greasy hair having some role to play in this .
sometimes dandruff does not cause much of a problem but when it appears on clothes or itches or leaves an unpleasant smell in the hair , the problem starts .
one 's chic appearance and dignity are blown away and dandruff becomes a question that needs an answer .
the question is , how do we treat it ?
there is general advice we have to pay attention which is :
1. not to use other people 's implements to comb one 's hair ,
2. paying attention to the cleanliness of our personal implements ... which means washing brushes and combs at least once a week ,
3. washing hair with specific treatment shampoos available in the shops .
here i would advise you to use nezoral shampoo , not because i 'm advertising it or anything but because this shampoo contains the substance ketoconazole and this substance is effective in getting rid of the yeasts which cause dandruff .
after using the shampoo , rinse your hair with vinegar diluted in water and massage the scalp .
here are some effective measures :
* wash you hair .
rub your hair with apple vinegar .
leave it on for a quarter of an hour .
rinse it .
* wash you hair .
mix 1/2 cup of apple vinegar with 1/2 cup of lemon juice .
massage your scalp with the mixture .
leave the mixture on your head for half an hour .
apply olive oil and leave for another quarter of an hour then wash your hair with shampoo .
repeat this process once a week until the dandruff disappears . you may not need to do it more than once .
* olive oil , almond oil and cactus oil help the scalp regain its balance and feed it .
my regards and stay well .

pains in the red sea
my father put a life jacket on me when he saw the al-ibara tilt and start to sink ,
after that , i saw my father drown then my mother ,
i remained alone for 30 hours battling the waves , helped by one of the survivors , until the rescue teams came and lifted me out of the water .
everything is lost ,
i was living in saudi arabia for three years where i had tasted the bitterness of life ,
i came back with the " fruits of my life " , to marry and settle down ,
but suddenly , everything was lost ... everything .
there was a fire in the lower decks of al-ibara ,
but the crew prevented some passengers who saw the fire from putting on life jackets under the pretext that it would cause unnecessary panic among other passengers .
you saw the result ,
al-ibara went down and with it more than 1000 passengers .
al-ibara 's crew told us when we saw smoke coming out of the engine room on the lower deck " do n't worry , we 'll put it out " .
when things got much worse , we could n't find the lifeboats because some workers on board the al-ibara took them and left us on the ship to face death alone .
i was in the water for 30 hours , battling death ,
30 hours without food or water ,
my skin nearly melted .
so where is respect for our humanity ?
if al-ibara 's passengers had been israeli , would they have been treated with such negligence and such slowness ?
god gave me the gift of three children , two girls and one boy , and we lived in saudi arabia together ,
then we decided to return home for good and settle in egypt ,
so i sent on my furniture and my children 's books and all our possessions .
shortly after sailing off , we were overcome with terror as we saw smoke rise from the ship ,
then it tilted and sank .
i saw my three children and wife as they screamed and swallowed water and i screamed and tried to save them but god was victorious .
they all drowned in front of my eyes ,
their books and some of their games floated on the surface ...
from him comes recompense .
in god only is there power and strength .
when the fire got really big , we heard the sound of explosions in al-ibara 's kitchen .
we thought it was from gas cylinders exploding ,
so we shouted at the captain to go back to the port of safaga which was closer than dhaba but he refused .
we became terrified and the captain ordered us to knock on doors to get passengers out of their cabins and assemble starboard side until the al-ibara regained its balance . but within five minutes everyone was drowning
and the shouting and wailing got louder .
men were imploring god " oh lord , save us ... oh lord , have mercy on us "
"
others were reciting the shahada .
****
may god have mercy on all the victims of the accident and grant their loved ones patience and solace

as it is a holy month and a very important month in god almighty 's eyes , the prophet may god 's peace be upon him included it and called it god 's month
it is the month of muharram .
voluntary fasting in this month is one of the best ways to become closer to god
and it is better than any other voluntary fasting during the year ,
for it is more than fasting .
and do not forget us in your prayers .
may god 's peace be upon our prophet mohammed and all his family and companions .

< headline > men 's chastity
< poster > abu suleiman
why does men 's chastity no longer have any value or respect ?
and is it now that a chaste man who rises above his sexual appetite gives rise to amazement and suspicion ?
why has become that a man who does not have islamically unlawful sexual relations before marriage is a fool in the eyes of some ?
why has the man who does not betray his wife become a coward who fears his wife will find out or whose masculinity is doubted ?
our society is greatly concerned with female virginity ,
but why does n't anyone talk about male virginity ?
in an era of openness and progress , which makes it easy to fall into what is sinful
temptations surround us on every side and are no longer difficult
to have and there is nothing easier than inequality , which draws people into depravity .
but this is no excuse to justify what is forbidden ,
and if women and men are subject to the same temptations , then they are equal in punishment and accountability .
according to god 's law , god almighty says : ( tell the believing men that they shall lower their eyes and maintain their chastity and tell the believing women that they shall lower their eyes and maintain their chastity ) .
and as it is more preferable and fairer to measure our behavior according to god 's rules and laws , we see that it gives clear indications that the concept is to be applied to both men and women .
god almighty said : { the chaste men , the chaste women , and the men who remember god frequently and the women who remember him , god has prepared for them forgiveness and a great recompense } [ al-ahzab : 35 ]
therefore men 's chastity is no less important than women 's chastity and does not diminish his manhood and just as chastity is required of women , so it is also required of men .
we must broaden the concept of virginity to include both men and women so that there is equality .
but in our eastern societies , these concepts have become erroneous ,
and chastity is expected of women only , which is their asset and the foundation of their family 's honor ,
whereas men 's chastity is not an issue or a matter of shame .
nothing is shameful for them , based on the principle that any sin is permitted as long as it is not made public .
this is a call to all to insist on chastity and to refrain from what is forbidden
and for us to abandon the common concept that male chastity is a dubious trait that a man is embarrassed by and avoids so that he is accused of stupidity , lack of education and poverty of experience .
male chastity means modesty and it is an honorable trait . it means he keeps his faith and follows the right path , and takes refuge against sin and god almighty 's wrath and preserves his health from disease .
chastity begins in the heart then reaches the body and in a man , it is a clear sign of a strong character and raises him above and keeps him from adultery so that he quells his sexual appetites and disciplines himself against being drawn in by its lusts .
the chaste person is a rational person able to control his desires and cravings and who only allows himself to satisfy them with what pleases god .
he is a patient and fair person who is beyond vile acts and rises above his appetite .
he has rare qualities which only one whose faith is strong is capable of having .
the holy koran calls on every bachelor
{ to let those who do not enter into matrimony be chaste }
thaleb interpreted this and said :
let him control himself by fasting for it is self - denial .
chastity is required of the married and unmarried .
how many men betray their wives and boast in their gatherings of their adventures so that they appear to be no less important than others or no less manly or so that they do not become laughingstocks ?
my dear brother , i ask you not to weaken and to preserve your purity and your chastity .
do not give in to temptation .
try and strengthen your faith in god .
for if you weaken , remember that god sees you and you will be asked and we will all be asked about our actions and your manhood will not bring you god 's forgiveness because god 's commandments are clear .
chastity is not required of women only , it is every human being 's duty .
do not let society be accountable for your actions .
if you evade accountability in the world , you will not escape punishment in the afterlife .
remember that death does not ask permission of anyone .
when it comes , it will not wait for you to repent .
for when their time comes , it comes not an hour later or an hour earlier .
if you have been content with the most vile of acts , do not expect and do not ask for the best of rewards .
remember that reward is dependent on acts of piety .
and if you do this , do not expect god to favor you with a good wife .
god almighty says in surat al-nur ( bad women for bad men , and bad men for bad women , and good women for good men and good men for good women , they are innocent of such accusations , they have attained forgiveness and a generous reward )
"
lord , i ask you for chastity and prosperity .
"
we ask god to guard the muslim youth from wrongdoing and evil .
god is the best protector and the most compassionate of the compassionate .
god almighty !

they tightened her shackles ...
they deprived her of her senses .
she felt as though she was put on what felt like a sedan ... with its height and movement ...
she heard the voice of her beloved among them .
why did n't he berate them ?
why did n't he stop them taking her ????
the sound of dull footsteps walking on rough sand ...
cool dawn breezes touching her white clothes ...
and even though she could n't see , she imagined the weather around her to be misty ...
she imagined the land she was in now to be empty , arid land ...
..
finally , the footsteps stopped altogether and she felt herself being put down on the ground ...
she heard a stone being lifted near her and another being put down ...
then a second one being carried ... and there was silence around her ... she felt darkness enter her bones ...
... it was her son ... yes him ...
no doubt he had come to save her ?
but ... what was she hearing ?
he was calling her softly : mother ...
and through tears , her husband spoke to her saying : hold on ...
patience with the first shock ...
pray for her , my son ...
come on ...
he was overwhelmed by a sigh ...
he cast one last look at the shrouded body ... and could not contain himself . he said in a voice dripping with pain : there is no god but god ...
there is no god but god ...
we come from him and to him we return
this is the last thing she heard from him ...
then the sound of marble stone falling from above to close the only opening that let through sound and light ... and life ...
the sound of footsteps retreating ...
where to ?
where are you leaving me ?
how can you leave me , alone in this darkness ?
she looked around her and suddenly saw ...
saw ????
what could she see in this dark cellar ?
its darkness was not the darkness of night she was used to ... because that was accompanied by moonlight ... and the rays of the stars was reflected on things and people ... but here she could barely see her hand ... she felt her eyes were completely blindfolded ...
she remembered her loved ones ...
she heard the footsteps fade away completely and a shudder ran through her body .
she got up to follow them ...
how could they leave her when they knew she was frightened of the dark and of being alone ?
but a heavy hand pushed her down roughly ...
she looked behind her with extreme fear ... and saw something she had never seen before ...
she saw the sphinx had become embodied as a creature ...
but how could she see him in spite of the intense blackness ?
she said in a trembling voice , " who are you ? "
she heard a resounding high - pitched voice to her right , we have come to ask you ... "
she turned round ...
there was another creature similar to the first ...
she was dumbstruck ...
she wished the earth would swallow her up so that she would n't see these entities ...
but then she remembered the earth had actually swallowed her up ...
she wished for death to escape this reality from which there was no escape ...
then she despaired that her wishes were no good ... because she was actually dead ...
- who is your god ?
- ha ... who is your god ?
- my god ?
i have worshiped only god all my life ...
- what is your religion ?
my religion is islam ...
- who is your prophet ?
- my prophet ?
she wracked her memory
what was the matter , she had forgotten his name ?
was it not always on her lips ?
did she not always bless his name five times a day in her prayers ?
with an angry voice , the voice asked her again : who is your prophet ?
a moment , please ...
i ca n't remember ...
a big stick was held aloft in the creature 's hand ...
she screamed ...
her limbs tensed ...
suddenly , the name came into her mind :
she shouted at the top of her voice : the prophet mohammed ...
mohammed ....
then she shut her eyes tightly ... but ... nothing happened ...
a deathly silence ...
she opened her eyes in surprise ...
the creature whose name was nakir said : you were saved by a prayer you always repeated ( o lord , you who turns hearts , make my heart steadfast in your religion ) .
a shiver went through her body ...
she wanted to smile with joy ... but she could n't ...
this was not the place to smile ...
o lord , when will these difficult moments end ?
a short while later munkir said to her , " you delayed in praying the dawn prayer ... "
she opened hr eyes wide ...
she knew there was no way out this time ...
because it was not untrue ...
he pushed her in front of him ...
she wanted to cry but tears found no way out ...
she walked in front of munkir and nakir along a long cellar until she reached a place that looked like a prison .
...
she felt sick ...
she wished she could faint ... but it did n't happen ...
she continued to look at the terrifying place ...
at every point , there was screaming and blood ...
wailing and destruction ...
bones being broken ...
bodies being burned ...
cruel faces with no mercy in their hearts for they did not respond to all this supplication ...
the angels pushed her from behind so she walked , feeling that her feet could no longer carry her ...
she came to a man lying on his back ...
and standing over his head was an angel , one of the ones with a cold , hard face ...
holding a heavy stone ...
right before her eyes , the angel dropped the stone on the man 's head ... it smashed and broke off his body , rolling down ...
she screamed
she cried ...
then she was so astonished that she stopped speaking ...
the head quickly came back to its owner ...
and the angel dropped the stone on him again ...
here ... it was said to her : , " come on ... lie next to this man ... - what ? "
- come on ...
she was pushed roughly ...
she resisted ...
and resisted ...
and resisted ...
to no avail ...
he fate was dark ...
truly dark ...
she lay down , with fear churning her stomach ...
she prayed to god ...
but saw all the doors of prayers closed ...
the time for prayer in this hour of need was gone ...
... if only she had prayed in times of plenty ...
if only she had prayed in the world ...
if only she could go back to pray two prayers ...
just two prayers ... to have mercy ...
she looked up and saw an angel standing over her ...
holding a big stone in his hand ...
saying to her , " this is your punishment on judgment day ... because you slept instead of doing your duties ... "
when despair overtook her ... she saw a young man as bright as the moon walking towards her quickly ...
a feeling of hope rose within her ...
his face was full of joy and his smile lit up everything around him ...
the young man came and put up his hand to stop the angel ...
he said to him : what 's the matter with you ?
i have been sent to her ... to protect her and stop you .
- is this an order from god almighty ?
- yes ...
she could not believe her eyes ...
the angel went ... disappeared ... and the handsome young man remained ...
was she dreaming ?
the young man extended his hand to her .
ùshe stood up ...
she asked him with gratitude , " who are you ? "
- i am your son 's prayer for you ... and his goodness towards you ...
since you died , he has not stopped praying for you so that god has reflected on his prayer with the best reflection and responded to it and allowed him to come here ...
she felt the presence of munkir and nakir once again ...
she turned to them
and heard them say : look ... this is your place in hell ... god has changed it to a place in heaven ...

how to transfer a cassette tape onto cd
< poster > mr. abuein
since the age of cassettes started , it is almost impossible to find a house free of cassettes ,
and with the ease of the use of cassettes and their cheap price , they are now found in every house , car , office and every other place .
some of these tapes are originals , professionally recorded and more expensive , some are recorded at home and such recordings may be valuable and of a special memory , or they might be a copy of songs or other things .
and because we are now in the digital age , this does not mean we have to erase our memories .
we can transfer these sound recordings , whether they are cassette tapes or 1/4 inch reels or records and change them into an mp3 digital format on digital cds . this allows you to hear it on a computer and cd players and to email it anywhere .
preparation of systems and equipment :
to be able to transfer tape recordings into a digital format on cd - roms , you first have to equip your computer with the necessary equipment and programs to be able to do this . you need a relatively new computer with a sound card .
to start , you have to connect the cassette player you have to the computer . this is usually done with the common lead shown in the photo here . this lead can be found in any place where electrical equipment accessories are sold and is usually cheap .
one end of the lead must be attached to the line - out outlet and the other end must be connected to the line - in outlet on the computer sound card .
another thing is the need for a program that can record sound which comes through the sound card line - in .
the best and easiest program to use is musicmatch jukebox . this program has many useful applications , and most importantly you can get it free on the internet .
download and set up the program on your computer .
you can visit the website to download it onto your computer . the address is http://www.musicmatch.com/
or from this link . click to download the program which is about 9 mb .
so that you can use the recording in any place , as well as to have a large enough space needed by the sound on the hard cd , it 's best to have a cd recording system .
cd recording systems can also read cds .
this equipment uses two kinds of cds and these two kinds of cds can record sound and information related to computer programs .
the first cd type can be recorded on once while the other can be recorded on several times .
the second is better but it 's several times more expensive than the first .
to get going :
step one :
after setting up the musicmatch program and attaching the stereo to the sound card using the lead mentioned before , you can start recording by following these steps :
start the musicmatch program .
from the menu , select options then recorder then source then line - in .
a new window will now pop up under the first program 's window . if it does n't appear , click on rec.
in this window , you 'll see the words artist and album . click on them then change the name to the new recording name you 're about to do .
now click on rec in this window and start playing the cassette tape in the stereo .
when the recording finishes , click on stop .
the recording should have ended and been placed in the program 's music library .
you can repeat this process for any other recording .
recordings are automatically saved at a speed of 128 kbps . this is more than enough for most tape recordings which need high quality .
once the first recording is done , you need to test it out to check the sound level quality .
if the recording is muddled or too soft , you can re - check the level of the sound input from the stereo to the computer or via the windows program itself .
at the bottom of the screen , you 'll find an icon in the form of a megaphone on the taskbar . double click it and adjust the sound using play control or volume control .
select options then properties then recording and finally ok . you 'll see a record control window . select the required sound volume level .
of course , make sure you do n't use the mute button or you 'll get nothing at all .
you can use extra recording features in this program to adjust various properties to improve sound . to do this , select options then settings then recorder then advanced .
in this box , select the sound effect you want such as fades and so on to produce semi - professional mp3 recordings .
as you gain experience of this program and continue to make recordings , you 'll become more familiar and find it easier and become quicker at turning your old analog recordings into digital recordings .
after you make mp3 recordings with a total length of 74 minutes at the most , you can start making a cd - rom .
step two :
after you select and collect enough mp3 recordings , you can make this into a list to record onto the cd - rom in the order you want .
you 'll find a recording list on the right - hand side of the musicmatch jukebox program .
to copy a song or musical piece onto this list , use the mouse to drag the file from the music library to this window .
in general , a recordable cd can hold 74 minutes of music ( at present , the musicmatch program is n't compatible with the new 80 - minute recordable cd )
once you 've prepared the pieces of music you want to record onto disc , click the cd window and a new dialogue box will appear with several cd recording options .
make sure you select audio default as the disc type to search for . if you select the other option , you can store over 600 megabytes on the blank cd but this type does n't work with the usual cd players .
the status bar at the bottom of the window shows how much space is left on the cd .
you can add or delete from the recording list by using test then write to the cd to produce more detailed cds .
you may also want to leave a second 's space or more between two tracks .
when you 're ready to copy , put the blank cd in the cd recorder and click on create cd .

< poster > mr. abuein
i beg you in god 's name to please read this before deleting it !
look at god 's mercy on you and humble yourself before it
look at god 's compassion on you and learn humility and look at his kindness to you and his care for you
god says in the hadith qudsi : " i and man and jinns are far apart . "
i create and others are worshipped
i provide sustenance and others are thanked
my goodness to mankind descends and their evil ascends
i treat them amicably with grace yet i do not need them
they become hateful to me because of their disobedience yet they need me
people of remembrance , he who wants my company should remember me
people who obey me , people who love me
people who sin are not to despair of my mercy . if they repent i am their beloved , if they refuse i am their healer . i scourge them with disasters to purify them of their sins . who comes to me from afar repenting i will welcome and he who turns from me i will call him from nearby and say to him : where are you going ?
do you have a god other than me ?
one good deed is to me worth ten good deeds or more and a bad deed to me is worth one and i also forgive . byâ my glory and my majesty , if they ask for my forgiveness , i will forgive them their sins .
forward this even if it is to only one person and get the reward !

< headline > new steals the limelight from google
< poster > mr. abuein
one thousand new members every day
the new myspace site is stealing the limelight from google .
www.myspace.com
a promising new star in the world of the internet has recently begun to shine , especially after succeeding in coming up with a name that is reverberating in technology circles .
this newcomer has , in the course of only two years , attracted many more visitors and users than expected , bringing the number of users and visitors to two - and - a - half times the number of visitors to internet giant google .
the myspace site has proved itself to be serious and has become one of the most important internet communities .
the secret of this site 's success is how it has made use of its predecessors ' mistakes and turned them into strengths which makes it very attractive to young people , especially students and musicians after it gave them the possibility of total interaction with their friends and provided the majority of services offered by other sites in one site .
some might question the secret of the site 's success since it is not the only one of this kind but quite simply , why should its users need to go to another site when their friends are on myspace , especially as users encourage their friends and urge them to join the site .
it is also doing better than its competitors because it is more open to customization which gives the user greater scope for adding a personal touch to his page through background color , layouts , images , videos and many other specifications . the feature that has set it apart from even its most tenacious competitor , friendster , with registered users now at 54 million ( a rate of 180,000 new members a day ) compared to 24 million users on the friendster site .
this new site brings in a new tool to allow you to talk to your acquaintances and friends , it has cancelled the main page , the need to download emails or an instant messenger program , the page through which the user can chat and swap emails as well as being able to listen to teachers and lessons .
in the midst of all this success , internet dangers hang over teenagers to cast a shadow over the site 's success , especially since the number of minors registered with the site has reached a quarter of its total users .
many school children all over the united states of america were arrested after they threatened their school friends over the internet . in addition , the police in one state discovered cases of illegal relations with minors who got to know men who pretended to be younger than their age on the site . this led to parents and guardians stopping their children from using the sites because of fears about dangers such as this .
this has not stopped the site owners from moving forward to develop it and provide international services to broaden the scope of users to bring in users from all over the world under the slogan " we 'll do anything to make our users stay with us . "

1 - drink a lot of fluids , up to two liters a day .
2 - do n't sit in a room full of dust and smoke .

less than 60 cm from the eyes ) .
4 - sit in a position that does n't tire the eyes ( your head must be higher than the computer screen ) .
- give yourself a 10 minute rest every hour and look at the window , sofa or fridge or anything else other than sharp , bright computer colors .
6 - blinking a few times in an hour helps the eyelid muscles relax .
7 - make sure the room has sufficient lighting .
8 - do n't stare for a long time without blinking ( this must be done once every five seconds ) .
9 - always make sure your screen is clean .
finally , i 'd like to say : the eyes are one of the body 's most important organs
so do n't be mean about caring for them and give them a chance to rest .

this is how love is
< poster > yamuslim - owner < msm77777 @ ... >
this is how love is
main : wednesday 9 muharram 1427 ah - february 8 , 2006 ce , islam diary :
for muslims to know the status of their prophet peace be upon him ... and for muslims to know what real love for this great prophet is ... these were the situations
abu bakr , may god be pleased with him ...
here are the feelings that abu bakr 's heart puts into words that can be read ,
abu bakr says , " we were making the migration and i was thirsty , very thirsty , so i brought some yoghurt drink and gave it to the prophet ( peace be upon him ) and said to him , " drink , o prophet of god " . "
abu bakr said , " the prophet ( peace be upon him ) drank and my thirst was quenched ! ! "
your eyes are not lying !!
the word is right and intentional , this is how abu bakr al-sadiq told it ...
can you taste the beauty of this love ?
it is a special kind of love !!
how do we compare with such love ! ?
here it is and do n't be surprised ,
it is love ,
love for the prophet above the self ...
on the day mecca was liberated , abu qahafa ( the father of abu bakr ) became a muslim . he turned to islam very late in life and was blind so abu bakr took him to see the prophet ( peace be upon him ) so that he could declare his faith in islam and pay homage to the prophet ( peace be upon him ) .
the prophet ( peace be upon him ) said , " o abu bakr , you should have left the sheikh in his house and we would have gone to see him " .
abu bakr said , " you are the more worthy of being visited , o prophet of god " .
abu qahafa became a muslim ... and abu bakr al-sadiq began to weep .
they said to him , " this is a joyous day , your father has become a muslim and avoided hell , so why then do you weep ? "
imagine ... what did abu bakr say ?
he said , " because i would have liked the person to be paying homage to the prophet not to be my father but rather abu talib , because that would please the prophet more " . glory to god , his joy at the prophet 's joy is greater than his joy for his father .
where are we compared to all this ?
omar ( may god be pleased with him ) says , " i was walking with the prophet ( peace be upon him ) and with us were some of his companions . god 's prophet took my hand as we walked " .
omar says , " i found myself saying : , " i swear by god , o prophet of god , i love you ! " "
the prophet ( peace be upon him ) said to him , " more than your son , o omar ? "
i said , " yes " .
he said , " more than your parents , o omar ? "
i said yes ,
he said , " more than your money , o omar ? "
i said " yes " .
he said , " more than yourself , o omar ? "
i said , " no " [ look at his truthfulness to himself and to the prophet ( peace be upon him ) ] .
so the prophet ( peace be upon him ) said , " no , o omar , your faith will not be whole until i am more beloved to you than own self . "
omar says , " i went out and reflected then came back chanting : i swear by god , o prophet of god , you are more beloved to me than myself . "
the prophet ( peace be upon him ) , " now , o omar , now " .
abdullah bin omar said , " what did you do , my father , to come with this ? "
omar said , " i went out and asked myself who i needed more on judgment day , myself or god 's prophet ? "
i found that my need for him was greater than my need for myself ,
and i remembered that i had strayed from the right path and god saved me through him .
abdullah bin omar said , " o father , if you were to forget everything about god 's prophet , what is the thing you could never forget ? "
omar said , " if i were to forget what i have forgotten , i will never forget the day i went to him saying : permit me to go on a pilgrimage , o prophet of god . "
he said to me , " do not forget us my brother in your prayers of goodwill . "
he said a word , what pleases me is what there is for me is life !
those who only read these words will not feel them ...
they are , i swear by god , sentiments that need a heart that loves the prophet ( peace be upon him ) to receive them as they are meant ... tender and soft
thawban ( may god be pleased with him )
the prophet ( peace be upon him ) was away and left his servant with thawban . when he returned , thawban said to him " i missed you , o prophet of god " and wept .
the prophet ( peace be upon him ) said to him , " this makes you weep ? "
thawban said , " no , o prophet of god , but i remembered your place in heaven and my place , and i remembered loneliness . "
and god almighty 's words were revealed { he who obeys god and the prophet , these are with those god has been pleased with , of prophets and righteous people and martyrs and the pious ; fair company are they } [ 69 ] surat al-nissa .
sawad ( may god be pleased with him )
on the day of the uhad battle , sawad bin izzya was standing in the ranks of the army when the prophet ( peace be upon him ) said to the army , " stand straight ... stand erect . "
the prophet looked and saw sawad was not being disciplined .
the prophet ( peace be upon him ) said , " stand straight , o sawad . "
sawad said , " yes , o messenger of god but he did not stand straight . "
we heard the trunk wail at being parted from the prophet ( peace be upon him ) .
the prophet ( peace be upon him ) came and with his stick tickled sawad on the stomach .
sawad said , " you hurt me , o messenger of god , and god has sent you with the truth , so lead me ! "
when they built the pulpit for him , he left the trunk and went to the pulpit .
we saw the prophet ( peace be upon him ) leave the pulpit and go back to the tree and stroke it .
he said , " stand straight , o sawad . "
the prophet ( peace be upon him ) was orating at his mosque , before the pulpit was built , next to a tree trunk when his companions saw him ... the prophet ( peace be upon him ) stood touching the trunk .
what do you think of this love ?
lastly , do not be less than the trunk .
he said , " o prophet of god , i think today is a day of martyrdom so my last wish is for my skin to touch your skin . "
the prophet peace be upon him says , " are you not happy to be buried here and be with me in heaven ? "
the trunk became still ...
sawad bent eagerly to kiss the prophet 's stomach . he said , " this is what i wanted . "
the prophet revealed his noble stomach and said , retaliate , o sawad . "

why is most of the koran addressed to males ?
< poster > yamuslim - owner < msm77777 @
http://www.islamtoday.net/questions/show_question_content.cfm?id=102303
title : why is most of the koran addressed to males ?
answerer : doctor mohammed hussein al-jizani , member of the teaching staff at the islamic university , the prophet 's city
new category 12/01/1427 hijra
question : in the koran , we see that in general that god addresses men , and this is also true in the prophet 's hadith . why is this ?
answer : praise be to god and peace be upon god 's prophet :
this question was asked by the mother of the believers , umm salma ( may god be pleased with her ) when she said , " i said to the prophet ( peace be upon him ) : why is it that we are not mentioned in the koran as men are ? "
god sent down his words : " muslim men and muslim women , male believers and female believers ... [ al-ahzab : 35 ] . source ahmed ( 26575 ) and al-tabari 's interpretation ( 22/10 ) .
as the holy koran was revealed in the language of the arabs and in the way they addressed women , women are included when men are addressed because the masculine takes precedence over the feminine in arabic .
the man says , " come in " and " go out " . in this way , he addresses all those present , both males and females .
in the language of the arabs , it is not correct to say come in ( masculine ) and come in ( feminine ) , and go out ( masculine ) and go out ( feminine ) .
it is also clear from the sharia and its intended meanings that the obligation to abide by sharia law concerns both men and women because all have obligations and all are addressed , all are accountable , rewardable and punishable .
this is the unchanging basis and general rule and it is that men and women are bound by religious laws in equal measure .
however , there are some rules that apply to men and not women , such as gold and silk being forbidden and the duties of friday prayer and jihad .
there are also some rules that are specific to women and not men such as wearing the hijab and caring for children and other matters made necessary by the nature of the two genders . god alone is knowledgeable .

allah 's tradition concerning someone whom muslims are not able to take revenge against such as someone who insults the messenger or harms him http://www.dorar.net/book_view.asp?book_id=7435
shiekhul islam ibn taymiyya - may allah have mercy on him - said , " it is part of allah 's tradition that allah the almighty will take revenge for his messenger against anyone who has harmed allah and his messenger whom the believers cannot punish and this will be sufficient .
the story of allah destroying those who made fun one by one is well - known . the exegetes of the koran mentioned them . they were a number of people from among the leaders of the quraysh ; among them were walid ibn mughirah , al-aas bin wa'il , al-aswadan bin al-mutallib , ibn abd yaguth and al-harith bin qais .
the prophet , may allah 's peace be upon him , wrote to the chosroe and the byzantine emperor and both of them did not accept islam but the byzantine emperor honored the letter of the messenger of allah , may allah 's peace be upon him , and he honored his messenger . he recognized his authority and it is said that he said , " the power will remain among his offspring until the day ( 1 ) " ,
and the chosroe tore up the letter of the messenger of allah , may allah 's peace be upon him , and he mocked the messenger of allah , may allah 's peace be upon him , so allah killed him after a while and his reign was torn apart and the chosroes lost their authority . furthermore , allah knows best .
in al-kalam al-sa'ir , it says , " the flesh of scholars is poisoned " ; how then is the flesh of the prophets , peace be upon them ?
in sahih , it said about the prophet , may allah 's peace be upon him , " allah the almighty says , " whoever is an enemy of a close friend of mine has entered battle against me " ; how then is it for those who are enemies of the prophets ?
whoever fights allah has been fought .
if you read some of the stories of the prophets mentioned in the koran , you will find that their peoples were destroyed when they harmed the prophets or did horrible things to them or said terrible things to them . this was the case of the children of israel ; they were humiliated and earned allah 's anger . they did not have a protector when they killed the prophets unjustly bringing them into disbelief , as allah stated in his book .
perhaps , you will not find anyone who insulted any of the prophets and did not repent excepted that allah inflicted a calamity on him .
we have mentioned what the muslims experienced when trying to expedite revenge against the disbelievers who insulted the messenger of allah , may allah 's peace be upon him , and we have mentioned such things through various events . this is an enormous chapter . we have not gone into depth in it here . our intention was to state the shariah ruling on it .
similar to this is what lots of honest muslims with understanding and experience have discussed with us about what they experienced many times in the blockade of forts and cities on the syrian coast , when the muslims besieged the byzantines in our time . they said , " we used to lay siege to a fort or a city for a month or more than a month and it was not possible for us to enter until we almost gave up hope unless its people dared to insult the messenger of allah , may allah 's peace be upon him , and dishonored him , it would then make it faster for us to conquer and made it easier . it would take no more than a day or two or something like that , then the place would be conquered violently and there would be a great massacre of them " . they said , " we would even rejoice that the conquest would be soon if we heard them slander him with our hearts full of hate for them for what they said about him " .
some of our honest brothers from morocco have told me similar stories about their situation with christians as well . it is allah 's tradition that he punishes his enemies sometimes with punishment from him and sometimes at the hands of his faithful servants .
the almighty protected him and took away the harm and insults of people in all ways , even in their words .
in the sahihain , it is narrated that abu huraira said , " the messenger of allah , may allah 's peace be upon him , said , " do you not see how allah has turned away the quraysh 's insults and curses ? they insult objectionably and they curse objectionably and i am muhammad " , so allah made his name honorable and saved him from harm and turned it on to the one who is objectionable , as if the insulter had intended himself .
what proves that insulting is a crime in addition to being disbelief and an act of war - even if it included that - is that the prophet , may allah 's peace be upon him , would forgive the hypocrites who harmed him as they came closer to the koran and he would kill them as is mentioned in the hadith narrated by abu bakr and others .
if insulting was merely an act of apostasy , it would enjoin killing this person just as the apostate must be killed . it must be known that he may succeed in insulting the prophet , may allah 's peace be upon him , in that he can be forgiven .
what proves that insulting is a singular crime is that if a dhimmi insulted a muslim or someone the muslims have pledged to protect , he nullifies his right to protection ; is insulting the messenger of allah , may allah 's peace be upon him not insulting anyone ?
he said , may allah have mercy on him , " purifying the earth of traces of insults against the messenger of allah , may allah 's peace be upon him , is obligatory where possible , because it is one of the clear signs of the religion of allah , the superiority of the word of allah and of all religion belonging to allah . furthermore , the earth must also be purified of fornication , theft , highway robbery where possible , whereas purifying it of disbelief is not obligatory to allow the people of the two books to continue following their religion as dhimmis because by establishing them as dhimmis means they must adhere to the course of allah and his messenger 's rule over them by not denying his religion or the superiority of the word . a truce is permitted to be made with a disbeliever and to protect him if he is weak or if there is a desired purpose in this .
the world must be purified of all crimes insofar as is possible , the punishment for the perpetrator being determined in the law unless it has a specific merit ; it is obligatory to kill this person , because this crime does not have a specific merit , because it concerns the right of allah , his messenger and all the believers . for this reason , there is a difference between an insulter and a disbeliever , who is allowed to admit his disbelief in private and adhere to the rules of allah and his messenger , contrary to the view on insults .

< headline > invoking god 's name in the wc
< poster > kg < ghazyk @ ... >
is a muslim allowed to read the koran or invoke ( in the mind ) god 's name in his heart , without uttering it , while in the bathroom ?
answer :
thanks be to god .
there are two types of invocation : invocation through utterance , such as reading the koran and invocations and prayers which it is desirable to do , and invocation in the heart by thinking about god almighty and his greatness and abilities , and thinking about god almighty 's creatures and reciting the koran in the heart . this recitation of the koran does not carry the same merit as reading the koran out loud which can only be done verbally . this is also true of prayers which have to be uttered verbally and cannot simply be recited in the heart .
religious thinkers make a distinction between the two types of invocation and say : it is hateful to invoke god 's name in the bathroom verbally to glorify him in this place . as for invoking his name in the heart , they say : this is not hateful and is acceptable .
the differences between the two kinds of invocation of god 's name is that religious thinkers agree that one can think of the koran in the heart but reading it and uttering it aloud are forbidden .
al-nuwawi said : they agreed that if the koran is recited in thought without the tongue moving then the reader will not have committed the sin of forbidden reading . al-nuwawi 's commentary on correct muslim conduct ( 4/103 ) .
ibn al-munthir says : aqruma said do not invoke god 's name with your tongue while in the wc but only in your heart . al-awsat ( 1/341 ) .
the permanent committee says : muslim etiquette is for a person to invoke god 's name when he wants to enter the wc or bathroom and to say before entering : " god i implore you to guard me against what is foul and obnoxious " and not to invoke god after entering but to remain silent once he has entered . advisory opinion of the permanent committee ( 5/93 ) .
sheikh abdulaziz baz says : invocation in the heart is permissible at all times and in all places , in the bathroom and elsewhere . but what is hateful in the bathroom and thereabouts is invoking god 's name verbally to glorify him , unless his name is mentioned during ablutions because this is permissible if it is not possible to perform ablutions outside the bathroom since this is a duty according to some religious thinkers and a convention among people in general . advisory opinion of sheikh ibn baz ( 5/408 ) . god alone is all - knowing .
