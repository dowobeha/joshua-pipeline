the so - called ( and coercive ) " brothers " round off their claims by silencing those who act on their behalf and blocking their ears to what they have to say .
they are under the illusion , or delude themselves , that french muslims are either incomplete in their islam or are helpless .
and so they need sheikh ahmed al-zayn , the sunni religious judge ( hanafi - shafii ) in saida or his likes ( al-hayat on the 6th of this month ) to reinstate their right to guidance and religious knowledge or will and ability .
no doubt this is the heart of the matter and issue .
the huthaibi " guide , " sheikh yusif al-qardhawi , sheikh mohamed rashid qabani , " sheikh " ahmed khatami , sheikh mohamed hussein fadhlallah , sheikh ahmed kiftarou , and others who share their view , regard muslims , by birth or origin , as muslims to whom the matter of belief and faith , and the matter of sovereignty over belief and faith , does not belong , in other words not to muslims themselves but to " religious scholars " and those who decree religious beliefs .
the media has reported the statements of sheikh sayid tantawi , al-azhar 's sheikh , may god favor him and us , concerning the french government 's ban on muslim girls wearing headscarves in schools where he stated that this is the french 's government 's right : " if a muslim woman is in a non - muslim country , such as france , and its officials decide to pass laws opposing muslim women wearing the hijab , then this is their right .
this is their right .
this is their right , and i repeat that this is their right which i cannot oppose " ( al-hayat 31/12/2003 ) .
the fact is that when i heard speech from the noble sheikh of al-azhar , i was amazed .
he is a respected islamic figure and his position holds great sway throughout the world .
i have met him more than once , such as on the occasion of my visit to his office , in november 1997 where we noted the courteousness of his manner and his forgiving approach , profiting from his opinions about the topics covered which spring from great learnedness .
this is why there was much amazement with regard to the statement mentioned .
the strong growth witnessed by the private sector last year was accompanied by several factors which resulted in increased confidence in the national economy which is expected to have a positive effect on private sector growth rates for the current year too .
among these factors was the drop in interest rates on domestic currency deposits for traders in low interest rates over the dollar and allowing the local and foreign private sector to invest in projects to produce natural gas , electricity and water and privatization of a portion of " saudi telecommunications " company shares .
the saudi stock market 's performance last year was good and the market indicator rose by 76.2 percent , shored up by falling local interest rates and high liquidity rates , in addition to the return of saudi capital from abroad and good results for listed saudi companies .
government expenditure for 2004 is also expected to exceed the levels predicted in the budget , in other words the government is to follow the same expansionist financial policy as it followed last year , leading to 2 percent growth in the government sector , while the saudi private sector is expected to grow by 4 percent , shored up by low interest rates and excess liquidity .
growth in the non - oil sector , whether governmental or private , will compensate for the oil sector 's predicted negative growth to reach a fixed - price gross national product of 2 percent this year .
while kuwait achieved an increase in the fixed - price gross national product of around 1 percent in 2002 , this increase rose to around 4 percent last year .
are secular iraqis aware that the united states has for a long time exploited backwardness resulting from the degrading following of the west 's agendas , particularly secularism , which some of them among us are calling for ?
did they imagine that they were weakness factors in the nations of the arab and islamic regions that could be exploited to assert hegemony over the " middle east " and strip it of its natural resources ?
specialist american research centers endeavor to present research where the " third world " is presented as though it does not possess a scientific mind capable of developing its natural resources , especially oil !
there is much evidence in support .
this policy is characterized by hegemony , greed and self - interest .
it is an ancient policy in western ideology which dates back to the attempts of socrates and his pupils , plato and aristotle , to conjecture a philosophy of hegemony and control of others through their claims for the superiority of the western individual , the basis of all hegemony .
this is why the renowned economist adam smith said openly : " if each western individual aimed for self - interest , general wealth would be a certainty . "
the iraqi kurdish leadership 's demand for federalism prior to free elections throughout iraq is conclusive evidence of the kurdish leadership 's concern about the kurdish people 's will and not of the minorities which infiltrate so - called iraqi kurdistan .
proof of this is that this leadership has not held elections in iraqi kurdistan over the past 12 years even though this was possible each year .
what has kurdistan 's government given the kurdish people other than fighting between the sheikhs of the barzani and talabani tribes at the cost of kurdish blood ?
they having been trading in this blood for 40 years .
as is customary , when fighting breaks out between barzani and talabani , it does not stop until a third party intervenes .
as is known , this permanent peace between them came late from the american referee .
and if fighting breaks out between them , when they are within the borders of their federal state , who will intervene between them to stop the kurdish people 's blood from spilling ?
the economic prospect for most egyptians since the liberation decision to the present day is still effective within the conviction that any crisis that can be remedied or mitigated is merely a " crisis of confidence " which , if it worsens , will not return to normal easily . the current climate is fertile ground for this to happen , in view of the lack of transparency in present situation and the lack of serious involvement of citizens in setting out the priorities .
but both sides , citizen and government , must heed the outcome of a " mutual boycott , " something which has not happened on the street since the bread crisis in 1977 .
each government has its problems and crises but , in the end , it has been a " nursemaid " to the citizen since mamdouh salim 's government in the early seventies through fuad muhialdin , kamal hassen ali , ali lutfi , atif sudqi and kamal al-janzouri 's governments .
however , the citizen views the present government as being separate and the cause of his problems , his torment and his hopes , even though the citizen is himself a large part of these problems .
the population problem is growing and the way of thinking about lifestyle is declining while expectations concerning luxuries grow regardless of income or its value .
most citizens agree that the pattern of disillusionment and anger at government relates to a clear failure to tackle the inflation crisis where prices increase continuously without a parallel increase in income , given that prices have risen by 40 percent on average since early july 2003 to date .
in spite of president hosni mubarak 's repeated and decisive recommendations for the need to ease the situation for the citizen and intensify meetings with the economic community , the government makes decisions without implementing them properly , leading some to finally call for the party to cooperate with the government to find solutions .
mr jihad al-khazin ( al-hayat on 1/22/2004 ) asserted the futility libya 's recent decision to disarm weapons of mass destruction with the allegation that its timing is not appropriate and that it has resulted in pressure on countries such as egypt , syria and iran .
the aforementioned asserted that this decision was no more than obedience to america 's " policy of the stick , " inferring this from the recent announcement by some american officials about the usefulness of the " stick policy " with which afghanistan and iraq were dealt with , in libya 's audacity to make its recent decision .
he reported a number of fabricated facts and distorted statements in order to prove that a libyan - israeli rapprochement may be on the horizon .
finally , not missing an opportunity to drive another nail into the coffin , he attempted to suggest that colonel gaddafi 's aid to palestinians went only to militant palestinian branches .
he ridiculed the libyan leadership , concluding that it helped egypt by imposing visas on egyptians entering libya just like it helped the palestinians before driving them out of the borders .
the recent libyan decision to disarm weapons of mass destruction and its timing are matters which concern libya only .
it knows best what is in its interests and what is not .
when talk about the shrinking and decline of israel 's deterrent capacity becomes a major component in the overt rhetoric of the israeli government and its organs , then the matter requires caution and care from further adventures by sharon and movaz and their chiefs of staff in order to restore low israeli morale and deeply stricken deterrent capacity .
firstly , palestinians must take this into account even though israel has turned them into an experimental field and tried out all kinds of weapons on them ; the palestinian leadership must be careful and the people and the factions must be careful .
hizbollah and its leadership , and all of lebanon , must be careful that this " wounded beast " does not escape .
syria and its leadership must guard against ever more vicious raids deeper into syrian territory .
the leaders of palestinian factions must be careful .
whatever the case , even if i accept the iraqi trade minister 's view as it is , a return to the past is pointless and what is needed is a way out of iraq 's political and security crisis and a reinstatement of iraq 's independence .
i spoke with mr alawi and listened to him without us agreeing , while having respect for his personal ability and ethics .
once again , i find myself in disagreement with the governing council which , in my personal opinion , includes seven or eight patriotic members whose patriotism is not in question , in particular adnan pacha chi whose name i mention in view of his role as the president of the governing council this month .
however , the majority are brokers and opportunists who returned to iraq on the backs of american tanks and these work for their self - interest and not for the good of iraq and the iraqis .
some members of the governing council know they will be finished if elections are held and this is why they oppose them . the reader need do no more than follow the proposals of certain council members such as the proposal to enlarge it and use it to replace the proposed national association .
exactly a year ago , powell presented a nightmare scenario to the security council by announcing that iraq held " huge " quantities of biological and chemical weapons and that there were links between the iraqi regime and the al-qaeda network .
he spoke of baghdad working toward acquiring nuclear weapons and the presence of huge quantities of substances such as anthrax and nerve gas .
that day , colin powell joined the ranks of the hawks , who created a war scenario before finding justification for it , and presented the nightmare scenario on their behalf to the international congregation .
this week , powell spoke in two different ways : he said he doubted he would have the same position backing war on iraq if he was informed that that country did not have an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction .
he stressed that the invasion of iraq was the " right decision , " justifying the invasion on the basis of iraq 's " intentions , " its weapons production capability and the threat posed by its regime , regardless of its weapons stash .
colin powell is a loyal " soldier " and he is secretary of state in an administration whose president wants to be re - elected again .
he can be excused in relative terms , but history will hold him to account later .
what is merely a falsehood in america is transformed into the bombing of people outside it , an endless war and a continued epic called pax americana .
the issue is not related to the mystery of politics as it appears to intellectual writers like christopher hitchens who shift from the left to the right as the intelligentsia 's center of gravity shifts from left to right and with the shift toward policies of identity in the third world and the collapse of the universal language shared with democratic forces in the west .
hitchens believes that the secrecy of " leaders " and their knowing the true objective of the war which can only be articulated through treatment , adjustments , maneuvers and spin is what makes the game attractive to intellectuals of the likes of wolfowitz .
in reality , this also makes christopher hitchen 's writing attractive but there is no more to the matter than that .
it is also making use of scandals and secrets , but it is a sophisticated usage for the elite .
politics is not run like this .
dreaming politicians and the monpolizers of readymade truths , such as the neo - conservatives , use political maneuvering and deception to reach an objective they believe to be noble .
ali al-sistani seized on america 's promise by the collar and held onto it , the promise to establish democracy and carry out elections on which the democratic system is based .
with this stance , he is helping the americans and members of the governing council to be diligent .
this is the first test of the reality of the promise of democracy in the region .
al-sistani took his first step , as the authority for the religious majority in iraq , when he asked an elected committee to come up with a new constitution .
with this , he has not moved away from what the iraqis are all aiming at and he has not moved away from the framework of democracy which the americans are attempting to establish in iraq .
the constitution is a reflection of the internal situation despite the internationalism of constitutions in the present day .
the constitution should therefore not anger anyone , making them abandon peaceful ways in demand of their rights because constitutions are a guarantee against violence breaking out and a guarantee for peaceful negotiation and the stability of the state and society , as is the case with prevailing democratic constitutions .
al-sistani took his second democratic step after announcement of the date and mechanics of the power handover to the governing council , what the united states means by the " iraqis . "
but the suspicion soon spread that there was a hidden intention to bypass the iraqi people and register the forthcoming democracy in the name of the governing council only or those known for their loyalty to it and to america directly .
the legislative development was sizeable and serious but what is noticeable is that this legislative development in europe follows on from the court 's efforts and endorses these efforts , while this development in the arab countries came to force the courts to alter their course , but the courts are rebelling !
the judiciary in arab countries is still under the belief that arbitration strips it not of its specialty but of its sovereignty !
this negates the outcome intended by the legislators when they amended arbitration laws and moves away international arbitration from the arab countries for it to take place in european countries where the judiciary is careful to protect the freedom of contracts and the freedom of arbitration .
but what does one notice in the arab countries ?
saudi arabia : after the new saudi arbitration law was issued , the religious courts continue to believe that the arbitration condition does not disqualify them from proceeding with cases in spite of the arbitration condition and even though one of the disputing parties might insist on arbitration .
this is a matter which moves one step forward and two steps back and has not been decided yet in spite of the clarity of modern saudi arbitration law which recognizes the arbitration condition .
syria : an international arbitration ruling was issued between " stahl a. gistelle and allies " ( swiss ) and the syrian " general fertilizer company , " a government company .
the scene shown on the screens was telling .
abdulkadir khan , the father of the pakistani nuclear bomb , went to see president pervez musharraf and put the matter in his hands .
he presented him with a bomb whose damage it would be hard for the president to escape .
musharraf looked gloomy and confused in his military uniform .
what khan said to him was dangerous , very dangerous .
he quite simply confessed to another side .
he had been dipping into the nuclear black market for a long while .
he went into the bazaar and traveled far .
he leaked secrets and information to iran , libya and north korea .
musharraf 's expression reflected the awkwardness of his position .
he knows pakistanis like this man more than they do him .
they see him as a hero who liberated a frightened pakistan from its old inferiority complex toward india .
it gave that anxious country , born of a bloody divorce , a feeling of security , that it would no longer be threatened and weak .
it gave it a feeling of strength and dignity .
the fatah movement was born 39 years ago .
its first bullets protected the cause from oblivion and drew the path 's features .
but the world it was born into is no longer there .
and the dispute it became enmeshed in has undergone changes and transformations .
so it is not strange that it is confused as a result of all these twists and turns .
and it is not strange that it has seen resignations presented and accusations handed out .
no one can deny fatah 's role .
and no one can deny yasser arafat 's role .
but it is the rights of every supporter of the palestinian cause to pose the question of whether fatah 's leadership made all the decisions that needed to be made in the face of external and internal challenges .
the letter of resignation presented by 400 middle - level fatah members did not include the names of any prominent leaders .
but a section of the letter showed the degree of confusion present in the movement whose role in facing up to israel or in negotiations with it cannot be substituted
the signatories said the movement had started to deteriorate from the inside as a result of internal disagreements .
i sit waiting for democracy and if it does not come the american way , then no doubt it will come to us the english way
for several days , i have closely followed the libyan foreign minister abdulrahman shalqam 's visit to britain and noticed that when asked during a press conference about the killing of policewoman yvonne fletcher outside the libyan embassy in london in 1984 , he responded quoting former british spy david shayler concerning the attempt by british intelligence to assassinate colonel muammar gaddafi .
as british foreign ministry remains silent on the matter , britain and libya have " turned out to be in the clear , " a killing for an attempted killing , and all that remains is for me to hear the opinion of policewoman fletcher 's family .
before this , the united states had suggested that arab leaders should follow the example of our brother the colonel .
i think what is meant is that they should follow the example of disarmament and leave israel as the only nuclear , chemical and biological state in the region .
this is a point which needs to be clarified so that no one makes the gradual move from the killing of opposition members and a british policewoman to terrorist operations , to the crashing of two commercial airliners , to the kidnapping of civilians , to arrive at the renunciation of weapons of mass destruction which exist only in the imagination of the democratically renewed libyan leader .
i will not bother the reader with a full article on libya ; i merely want to point out a few aspects of democracy whose delights we have missed out on in the middle east .
iran goes to the elections today to return a loser .
a quarter of a century ago , khomeini 's views attracted people .
they supported them and took to the streets .
they cheered and raised their fists in support .
the shah 's state collapsed .
the army , and with it savak and the entire machinery of oppression and subjugation fell apart .
a quarter of a century after the revolution won through the people , the revolutionary regime goes to the elections frightened of them .
the issue is not about mohamed khatami 's future .
from the beginning , it was no secret that it is he who is the supreme leader .
the issue is one of the regime , the revolution and country 's future .
recent weeks have shown the degree of fear felt by fundamentalists who have been made anxious by the wind blowing into the revolution 's citadel .
they are no longer able to contain the dance of democracy in spite of rules and checks set out in the constitution .
the final word , which the constitution gives to the supreme leader , is no longer enough to reassure them .
although his behavior is vitiated by a propensity to reconciliation , concession and coexistence , mohamed khatami has planted worrying questions in the heart of the regime .
poor paul bremer .
his suffering is beyond the scope of possibility .
he was given the task of sorting out what ca n't be sorted out and marketing what ca n't be marketed .
the iraqis did n't believe he came on a humanitarian mission and that his sole preoccupation was to build them a beautiful future .
suspicion , as well as complaining and anger , are iraqi traits .
poor man , his task is a difficult one .
the elation of saddam 's fall did not last long .
the iraqi nation has gone back to its original constituents .
dialogue with the " sunni triangle " is impossible .
satisfying the kurdish allies is hard because it angers allies and friends inside and abroad .
he talks to the shiites on the governing council and they point to najaf .
the man sitting in najaf wo n't meet him and prefers the united nations to the united states .
his task is exhausting .
time is running out .
there is no point in digging up the recent past .
there is no point in reviving the argument about the usefulness of the american war on iraq , and its attack without international authorization , and the principle of a preemptive war .
this is why george bush and his guest gerhard schroeder discussed the present and the future and ignored their disparagement of the recent past .
it would have been to the american president 's advantage to refute democrat claims that his way of managing foreign policy has lost the united states their european allies , including germany which plays a field role in afghanistan .
bush knows he needs " dissenting " europeans to encourage the united nations to play a role in iraq in order to make it easier for the united states to end the occupation , followed by elections and rebuilding the infrastructure .
he also needs dissenting europeans in any role that the atlantic organization might play .
and as the season is the election season , the white house boss has sent out messages reflecting his magnanimity .
american defence secretary james schlesinger called in the british ambassador to washington , lord cromer , and informed him that the states would not put up with threats from a " backward , under populated country " and that he no longer excluded use of military force by the united states .
he excluded other possibilities such as replacing " leaders who cooperate " with current opposing arab rulers or threatening with gunboat diplomacy .
the embargo announced by opec member arab countries was aimed at pressuring the united states and other western countries to force them to withdraw from arab land and this continued into march 1973 . the united states lost only 13 percent of its imported oil but this caused it major problems .
initially , schlesinger estimated that the operation would need two brigades , one for the kingdom of saudi arabia and another for kuwait , and possibly a third for abu dhabi , with britain 's assistance .
this was 30 years ago while news today , all of it published and correct , includes :
saudi arabia now produces around eight million barrels of crude oil a day and can increase this to ten million . it intends to keep production rates at around 5.1 million barrels until the year 2011 .
anyone who follows the situation in iraq is entitled to wonder whether there is a thread tying together the bloody attacks on differing sides .
he would be entitled to wonder whether the thread tying together the bombings and assassinations targeting religious or political symbols is drowning the arena in blood - spattered chaos , ending any hope of an iraqi authority able to provide security and stability ?
one could wonder whether the bombings are also aimed at undermining stability in the region as a whole by means of the poison which bloody areas of engagement between basic sections of the iraqi people could trigger .
that is without forgetting an important question which is will iraq merely turn into an arena for bigger wars , especially the war waged by those " the war on terrorism " targets in the aftermath of september 11 , 2001 ?
it is obvious that yesterday 's massacre was aimed at sparking the fire .
the locations of the crimes and the ways they were conducted with the aim of launching a series of reactions result in iraq being drowned in a hellish cycle that is hard to escape from .
and because the moving turmoil is so serious , iraqis must crystallize a reaction which goes beyond the recommendations of the rulers and statements of denunciation and condemnation .
the iraqis have not accused the american forces of being involved in the bombings the day before yesterday which turned baghdad and karbala into bloodbaths .
there is really no advantage to the americans in taking part in such an act .
such an involvement would push the large shiite majority into becoming involved in the armed resistance .
this would be an involvement that might torch the land of iraq under the feet of the occupiers .
to the contrary , the american administration has in recent months started to suggest that the reverberation of bombings against the " alliance force , " international headquarters and religious symbols are the work of a resistance which has come from abroad .
the carnage the day before yesterday contributes to what the americans are trying to avoid , as it is difficult to suppose that what happened served the agenda of any iraqi group .
the iraqis did not accuse the americans , especially after it became apparent that suicide attacks played a role in the karbala and baghdad massacres .
however , iraqi groups accused the americans of failing to bear their responsibilities in their role as an occupying power .
it accused them of a failure of security measures .
the truth is that it is hard to imagine a secure state under the shadow of occupation even if a date is set to end the occupation .
it is hard to combine occupation with security , in this country especially and in this region in particular .
as of today and until the summit of eight , there will be more and more talk about the greater middle east initiative which is based on the principle of a greater middle east partnership .
this is putting the cart before the horse because it takes for granted cooperation between middle eastern countries and israel , while the killing and destruction continue , as though the palestinians are from another world and their situation does not concern the arabs and muslims in the region .
i stop for a moment to raise a point of suspicion for which i have no evidence other than that i know who drafts the american agendas , those sharonite likudites in the american administration and those whose sole loyalty is to israel .
the point is that the aim of the greater middle east initiative is to include turkey , iran , afghanistan and pakistan in order to make the arabs a minority within the project .
what the planners miss as a result of their israeli tunnel vision is that muslims may support the palestinians more than the arabs do - just ask any turk , pakistani , iranian or afghan for his opinion on the subject .
whatever the case , the greater middle east initiative is very dependent on the arab human resources development plan for 2002 and 2003 .
the project mentions three shortcomings with regard to freedom , knowledge and enabling women and the initiative mentions three requirements which are to encourage democracy , build an informed society and expand economic opportunities .
america is a big problem .
its friendship is costly and its enmity hugely expensive .
it is impossible for countries today to exist as though america does not exist .
you need it to obtain international certificates of good conduct .
you need it to agree to the fairness of elections and the correct management of the economy .
you need its signature on government records in the area of human rights .
you need it to access the international monetary fund and world bank .
no point in appealing to the security council if it does not approve .
the reports of its envoys are influential and often decisive .
were it not for its military machine and its prestige , slobodan milosevic would not be behind bars .
were it not for the forcefulness of the same machine , saddam hussein would still be living in a palace , gesticulating about another " mother of all battles " .
no substitute for it in preventing civil war and encouraging the president to take the path of exile .
when ramon can find nothing to lie about , he enlists the help of someone else , and in one chapter he quotes american defense secretary donald rumsfeld as saying that tehran helped al-qaeda and the taliban to pass their men through iran .
through iran to where ?
rumsfeld 's speech was in january 2002 and we now know that every accusation made by the american administration prior to the war on iraq was a lie .
and in iran 's case in particular , it waged a war against the taliban after its diplomats and nationals were killed in afghanistan and absolutely nothing ties it to al-qaeda and the taliban .
but ramon completes the lie by referring to a news item written by michael evans in the times according to which an al-qaeda official offered to bring its members into lebanon .
israel wants this and sends those who spread its false claims , except that this has not happened and will not happen .
the booklet ends with what israel actually wants , ramon proposing political and economic pressure on syria and iran to end their support for hizbollah , yet he seems to be confused in a previous chapter because at times he says syria 's backing is the more significant and at times he says iran 's is the more significant .
spanish socialist leaders might not like hearing any suspicions raised about the ideological or moral contention which the war in iraq has given rise to , especially with regard to the french position .
the spaniards , from the right and the left , and especially the left , admit that spain has had many vested interests in saddam hussein 's iraq over the past era , though of course not as big as france 's huge interests .
they also admit , particularly the right , long - standing american double standards in iraq , especially during the eighties .
when talking to spanish officials , the intensity of the political and cultural horizons of the contention at times tempers the essential nature of the contention about foreign policy between france and germany , on the one hand , and washington on the other , by regarding it as being essentially a clash of interests .
but anyone who wanders around not only spanish organizations but also the streets , in madrid and lately in barcelona , becomes totally aware of the importance of the european role in a country such as spain .
spain is an example of a country whose more advanced european environment has contributed to driving forward its progress , without a doubt placing it today on economic , cultural and scientific par in terms of progress and advancement .
in fact , the spanish economy , carried on the european bandwagon , has moved from an economy which provided workers to an economy which imports legally resident workers , the majority of whom come nowadays from latin america with around a third of incomers from arab north african countries .
in their contacts with their counterparts in other countries , iraq 's new officials , the former opposition , are still acting with the mentality of an opposition that requires the assistance and services of this or that country .
they ca n't yet believe , or to be more precise are not yet used to , acting like statesmen for a country which is preparing to be in better health than it was before .
these words are occasioned by the behavior of iraqi officials who visited lebanon via syria in recent weeks , the most recent of which was a governing council delegation , the council which until very recently was " illegal and does not represent the iraqi people , " according to the statements of the senior officials who met last week 's delegation with open arms - is n't it strange how things change !
what drew attention in the statements made by the delegation 's president , mowaffaq al-rubaie , after his meeting with the lebanese prime minister rafik al-hariri was that he said he asked him for concessions to allow iraqis to enter and live in lebanon and to look into improving iraqi - lebanese relations . what is stranger and more naive still is that he asked him for help in " improving the image of the new iraq in the eyes of other arab brothers . "
is it possible that such a request should be made by an official of an honorable and dignified state ?
who authorized mr. al-rubaie to insult the honor of the iraqis with such a request that is so demeaning for iraq and its people ?
and if al-rubaie is unaware of the standards which govern international relations then he should have at least consulted advisors .
we hesitated more than once in being so frank ; we have warned against the policy of making ministries a hotbed of nepotism and we promised to behave like a positive opposition .
an opposition which monitors the state of rule and rulers and attempts to correct their deviations , which are unfortunately many .
an opposition on par with western oppositions must remain strong , exactly as british prime minister tony blair wished for his country when he said he was sad that his opposition was weak .
we would like to reassure ministers and we say to them : do n't worry because , thanks to your enormous mistakes , your opposition is strong and growing bigger day by day .
iraqis use the expression " the measure is overflowing " with vehemence today as they watch , with greater and greater amazement , how deeply administrations , ministries and the governing council in the country have sunk into corruption , nepotism , bribes and deals .
these failings , which we thought our new iraq had put away forever , have worsened .
even the hajj draw , the holiest of religious obligations , is fraudulent and the poor applicant is deprived in order to grant the application of a prominent person .
the main motive which required implementation of the death sentence to be brought back was , as you mentioned , " to cover up the culture of civil war whose accretions were revealed by the records of convicts " whose lives were ended as we saw on january 17 , 2004 .
but this motive may not be the only one to have impelled officials to make the decision today to implement the death sentence in the case of convicts selected according to criteria related not only to the seriousness of the crimes committed but also to their sectarian affiliations , this in order to preserve sectarian balances .
implementing the death sentence may also have significance in terms of the culture of deterrence , oppression and intimidation .
it is aimed at creating an atmosphere of fear in the minds of not only those who might envisage committing a given crime for whatever reasons , but also in the minds of those who , according to the authority 's view , might be tempted by the notion of freedom , liberty and opposition or toppling the current ruling regime and system , or even the notion of rebelling at particular stage the region is passing through , something which frightens many among leaders .
this is why this was a hidden message but , at the same time , a clear one to take this as a lesson .
with regard to the view that lebanon did not become a " state of law " in order to revoke the death sentence : we share your view unreservedly that lebanon is not yet a " state of law , " or to be more precise a " state of rights " in the actual and european meaning of the expression etat de droit , like the western european countries , canada , japan and other countries , even though the lebanese legislature on the whole is a legislature aimed at making lebanon a " state of law and institutions " .
the practical reality lebanon is wallowing in is a clear indication that it is , as you say , a " state of non - law " or a " state of no - rights . "
what is the lebanese political leadership thinking of when we hear it speaking only grandiose words , talking only about facing up to israel and about resistance and spreading the culture of resistance when lebanon 's internal crisis is the basis from which we need to start to treat the problem ?
how can you want to " spread the culture of resistance " in the arab world while the lebanese citizen is the underdog of the influential minority which only sees in his torment the facade of compliance and submission into which the citizen is thrust at all levels of his life and day - to - day interests .
it is important to talk about resistance and the weapon of resistance , indeed it is extremely important , but what is the lebanese citizen to do as he follows the news about deals and scandals aplenty and watches the constant collusion among the ruling class .
whether loyalist or opposition , civilian or non - civilian , economic or judicial - constant collusion hampers a majority without creed , color or identity , other than that it is weakened and practically despised in the eyes of the powerful minority which sees no one holding it to account or stopping or deterring it ?
we live in the shadow of a culture of hypocrisy and politicians ' lies .
we live in the shadow of a new type of class system .
a fighting class , resistance class , nationalist class , financial class , armed class , intelligence class , mafia class : all of them feed on the people 's silence and their acceptance of crumbs from the table .
people who accept to be ruled according to class standards that are more outdated and tyrannical than the old class systems which we have long been told are what led to the war .
no , the leopard ariel sharon has n't changed his spots .
he sidesteps by complying with the requisites of the current phase , but his teeth and claws remain ready for attack .
there is an immediate need to maneuver as a result of the personal dossier colored by news of a bribe , which of course requires a trip to the white house , while george bush 's shares seem to be on the decline .
so there is absolutely no objection to sharon setting off a resounding sound bomb whose echoes reach many places :
firstly , to the corruption dossier which is closing in on him and involves his two sons , omri and jalaad , meaning that talk about the plan to withdraw from the settlements in gaza and the northern bank will turn the spotlight focused on the bribes dossier to the issue of settlements .
secondly , to the united states and george bush where talk about withdrawal appears to be an attempt to say that he is implementing the terms of the " road map " while the palestinians have not ended violence and " terrorism . "
thirdly , to the positions of his intransigent allies in government who have always tried to impose their conditions on him , even if these conditions are not in conflict with his policies .
throughout these years of negotiation , sonatrack has been involved in selling some of iraq 's oil within the framework of the united nations " oil for food " program .
at each stage in the export of iraqi oil , we were given quotas equal to the quota of other oil companies , including american ones , through sonatrack 's branch in london .
all this took place with the knowledge and approval of the united nations and not directly through the iraqis .
maybe this is the reason why we were invited to organize humanitarian missions for the people of iraq .
we also sent aid in the form of medication , medical equipment and food .
we supervised the training of around 60 petroleum engineers in algeria , as well as opening an office in baghdad and contributing to organizing trips for company executives , at a rate of two trips a year , to monitor the oil for food program .
there are many points of similarity between the iranian situation in the period after the collapse of the shah 's regime in 1979 and the iraqi situation after america toppled saddam hussein .
the biggest similarity is administrative slackness and former regime members ( shahanshahi in iran and baathist in iraq ) resorting to changing their colors and assuming the mottos of the new circumstances .
in practice , however , they continue the strategy of their former regime whenever they find a gap to break out of .
this applies to some iraqi embassies which have been reopened recently giving iraqis in exile hope , but many of them have been stunned by the reality of these embassies .
in the time of the departed regime , all iraqis suffered .
internally , the ghost of war and death in the vaults of the intelligence agency hounds everyone , even those who think they are accepted by the regime or integrated into its politics .
externally , the regime pursues thousands of those who escaped the daily grindstone of death through its intelligence apparatus and its pressure on iraqis in exile , the very least of which is preventing them from renewing their passports or authenticating their papers because the price for this is a pledge to work as informers for the embassy which is in reality just an intelligence cell .
it is not often that democracy goes hand - in - hand with war or that wars lead to the institution of democratic systems , in other words handing over power to the people instead of keeping it in the hands of generals , officers , colonels and corporals .
this is because there is a fundamental contradiction between the military ethos and the democratic ethos .
the former is based on segregation , according to rank , and on commands , obedience , and putting order and discipline above all else - even if the order is wrong - in accordance the golden rule that says : " act first then object , " though this may be by cutting off heads !
the latter is based on consultation and dialogue , putting the general good above individual interests and respecting the right to disagree and object . it does not recognize any right not covered by law , regarding the people as the source of authority , and therefore the ones who confer legitimacy and hold it directly or indirectly accountable .
accountability under the democratic ethos is the golden rule guaranteeing " discipline , " in other words order , and separating authorities so as to prevent one authority dominating another or one person holding sway over an institution , such that each authority is limited by another authority , without them warring with each other or colluding and working together for their own interests at the expense of the general interest , which is the interest of the nation with all its people , leading to a fall in estimation and loss of the legitimacy gained in the eyes of the nation .
no two would disagree , however little they know about economic affairs , that lebanon will be facing difficult financial liabilities threatening it with bankruptcy within a short time if a recovery does not occur , something which is now in the realms of the miraculous .
optimists talk about june 2005 as a liability with no escape from it unless lebanon succeeds , with the presidential elections , in renewing international faith in it , something which is now non - existent after the paris requirements vanished inside the leaders ' wars .
that faith , as those working in economics know , now involves a partnership with the european union .
whatever french president jacque chirac 's friendship for lebanon and whatever the special relations with president rafik al-hariri ( assuming he holds onto his position ) , there is no paris without european approval .
this is what gives the position which arose in brussels during the meeting of the council for cooperation and partnership with lebanon such importance .
evidently , as soon as the european position hit beirut , there were those who railed against interference in lebanon 's internal affairs which , to remind you , has full sovereignty and independence and is protected against external interference .
never mind , we have plenty of time ahead of us for condemnation , but let us hear the signification of the interference first .
as soon as each of the two sessions in alnajma square ended , which were previously regarded as having no value whatsoever apart from a little additional criticism of those who have not , do not and will not care about it , there were many who went to perform their " religious " duties in full obedience to his majesty the devil , the camera false witnesses , silent witnesses and the usual wrongdoers .
evidence of this is the propaganda cooking pot which , after the first session , dished out to the media the " idea " of no winner and no loser .
it is an incorrect idea on two levels :
the first level is that there are clear political winners who are those that control the cell sector within lebanon 's balance of power run by the syrian authority , a balance whose " economic " partnership includes many sectors with various beneficiaries , lebanese and non - lebanese .
the second level is that there are those who have been morally compromised by this particular dossier who have lost - morally speaking - to the scandalmongers and have definitely not tied with them on this front .
in the battle then , the scandalmongers have won politically .
was pentagon hawk richard perle the " scapegoat " which ahmed chalabi , his friend in the interim governing council , offered to be if bush 's administration wanted someone to end the scandal on incorrect intelligence information on iraq prior to the war ?
or did he choose to resign from the pentagon 's defence strategies committee in order to carry on with his profitable projects and ventures in iraq ?
the reason perle gave for his resignation , that of not wanting his controversial views to affect president george bush 's election campaign , seems less important .
doctrinaires like perle do not resign so easily from a powerful position such as this .
he occupied that post for 17 years and the linking of his name , especially last year , with more than one scandal did not affect him .
these scandals were not even connected to his stepping down as the council 's president last year but staying on as a member .
to identify the reason , one has to look at the iraqi dimension where two cases involve perle , the first being profitable deals related to iraq 's reconstruction and , prior to that , the war . investigations into them have begun and involve two companies , hollinger and boeing .
an additional conclusion is that the americans have not seen as difficult a palestinian - israeli situation as the current one .
it is not only that this is the most rightwing and extremist government in the history of israel but also that israeli public opinion is inflexible , which guarantees this government staying put and continuing , with one feeding the other .
as for the palestinians , the americans regard them as being in the worst circumstances since non - islamist civilians have no power to proceed with negotiations with sharon nor to challenge him .
this situation in turn led to the conclusion that there is little , very little , that can be done to improve the situation on the ground .
diplomats concerned with this information do no oppose american conclusions on this matter in principle , especially the impossibility of achieving anything at this time or the frightening situation the palestinians are living in , but they regard this situation as the logical outcome of israel 's persistent attempts since october 2000 at least to destroy all the elements for the construction of a palestinian state .
the americans have contributed to this trend , whether by remaining silent about the practices of sharon who hid behind the united states ' war on terrorism to act against all elements which could contribute to making up the palestinian entity , or by attacking the palestinian authority represented by yasser arafat and negating the possibilities of cooperating with him , making it easier for israel to distance him and putting the entire palestinian authority in quarantine .
one of the anecdotes about president elias al-harawi is that when he wants to gather together dissenting ministers at the council of ministers who he thinks might disagree with him on an issue that is not on the agenda which he wishes to propose , he would open his speech to present the issue by saying " there is a proposal by minister abdullah al-amin , " who was a member of one of the governments under al-harawi and at the same time the national secretary for the baath party in lebanon .
after presenting the issue , whatever it was , al-harawi would allude to his visiting ministers , whispering that " the brothers are in the know , " meaning of course the " syrian brothers , " which would guarantee the proposal , actually al-harawi 's proposal , was passed without objections or obstacles .
president al-harawi has told this anecdote on more than one occasion , and it has been remembered by many over the past two days during the rendering of the text of minister suleiman franjia 's final speech , which was important and railed against president al-hariri , accusing him of abandoning the " plan " of which he - i.e. al-hariri - is one of the architects , although he suggests that he is powerless with regard to the " arab national patriotic plan " which expresses committeemen to the alliance with syria .
a lot has been said about franjia , known for his excellent relations with the syrian leadership , deep - rooted and historical relations between the al-assad clan and the al-franjia clan , " father to son , " and which none of syria 's allies and its lebanese friends have achieved .
one of the paradoxes in this relationship is that suleiman franjia makes the most exaggerated pronouncements , which to many reach the stage of flattery and affectation to the point of losing their meaning .
as a result of this relationship , and in the rift with al-hariri , many saw franjia 's words as a " syrian message . "
such a conclusion is legitimate because it appears realistic for a moment yet is at the same time " imprecise . "
therefore , as long as we have the freedom , we must enjoy it whatever the obstacles .
it seems that this thinking is no longer hypothetical among some sections of this country 's society but has been put into practice for a long while .
as an example : the freedom of non - accountability which disengages rulers from the real issue .
so the official makes a mistake or a serious misdeed of the kind that leads to enormous losses for the country and its citizens .
but his freedom places him in a position enabling him to justify his mistakes as beneficial .
the freedom of non - clarification which equates victim with wrongdoer , in which case sonorous slogans that have existed from the period extending from the dawn of history to the distant future burst forth .
we have the recent discussions in parliament , the iraqi oil discrepancy , the cotoner helicopter disaster and the city bank serial are living examples of this .
thanks to the freedom of non - clarification , everyone can feel at ease and tranquil , for there is no accused only accusations , no wrongdoer whose identity , position , rank and relations are known , merely wholesale mistakes .
in most of his recent meetings , if not all , the syrian president was careful to reassert three positions which echo the importance he accords to emphasizing what syria is considering at present :
the first was his repeated praise of the maronite patriarch , mar nasrallah boutrous safir , and regard for his wisdom in dealing with the dangerous developments facing the region and , following on from this position , his concern for everything that brings peace of mind and relief to the christians .
the second is showing his support for president emile lahud beyond his national and strategic choices to confirm his faith in the " intentions of the state project " which the president is conducting away from fanaticism and vested interests .
this is what many visitors have heard the syrian president say .
the third is al-assad 's dismay at the lack of appreciation shown by some of damascus ' allies with regard to the perils and delicateness of the current period , and their persistence in drowning the internal situation in political rivalry and distraction with dossiers at a time that does not allow such self - indulgence and passion , through internal disputes whether related to the presidency or running the government and its dossiers , an example of which is the recent cell dossier .
i asked a minister friend for his view on the council of bishops ' recent position regarding the presidential elections and he answered by stressing the importance of this new - old position which dots the is and crosses the ts , whether it be with regard to specifications about the president 's character or the mechanics of his election .
he said the position , which is supported by bakarki within the framework of respecting the law and upholding the constitution , was now perfectly clear and closes the door on a great deal of interpretations and leaks about the qualifications for the presidency .
then i asked him about the real reasons which led to president emile lahud failing to implement the reform project and about those who , according to him , hindered the project . he shook his head without giving me an answer , so i asked him the names of those who hindered implementation of the project , but still i did n't get an answer .
so i said to him : is it possible that you have no answer in response to what president lahud stated on the topic of reform and its hindrance ?
he shook his head saying only : " not allowed ! "
i then asked myself : is there anyone who can claim that president lahud has a reform project ?
and who knows about it ?
it was completely laughable when egyptian foreign minister ahmed maher and the secretary - general of the arab nations league , amru moussa , stood in front of journalists and tried to keep the " secure secret " under wraps and preserve the total blackout surrounding the " joint arab development treaty . "
why all this concern with secrecy and mystery ?
is it because the arab citizen and public opinion in the arab countries have no right to know about matters and ideas related to the future of the arab project , may god preserve it from harm , or is it because these matters are the domain of governments and rulers only and people are , in the end , expected to adopt whatever the divine leaderships dictate ? !
the matter seemed laughable because citizens in arab countries read what the ap news agency reported about the saudi - egyptian reform initiative called " pledge and declaration to the arab people " which calls on the principal arab countries to become involved in the running of its political , economic , social and educational affairs .
how can these people participate in such delicate and important matters when the " treaty " which arab foreign ministers agreed on in order to develop joint arab activities remains a secure secret , as we said , to be then brought down on people 's heads after the arab summit in tunisia convenes - if it actually convenes ?
and why the doubts about where it is to be held ?
the outgoing president rashid karami preferred the bitterness of resigning in front of the chamber of deputies at the start of the session in order to deprive the opposition , which was threatening his government with a vote of no - confidence , of the opportunity of having this victory over him .
on resigning , he addressed emile al-bustani , the leader of the opposition campaign against the government then , saying " i will leave your heart smoldering by depriving you of the pleasure of seeing the government fall through a vote of no - confidence . "
loyalist deputies only switch sides when opposition deputies are in a position to bring down the government through a vote of no - confidence , whereas it is opposition deputies , being a minority , who resort to switching sides to deprive it of the vote of a guaranteed majority .
with regard to his view on the cell phone dispute between the prime minister and the communications minister , he said : if people in power appealed to constitutional institutions to decide their disagreements , what happened would not have happened , not just in this case but in every other case too .
the disagreement between president al-hariri and those who share his view and the opinion of minister qardahi and those who share his opinion must be resolved at the council of ministers , where the majority will support this view or that so that the government can face the chamber of deputies with a consensual view and position on the matter .
on the other hand , the government must defend its standpoint at the chamber of deputies and explain its view and position on all that is discussed . deputies will either be convinced and the matter will be over or they will not be convinced , in which case the majority will decide the matter by voting either in favor of the opposition or in favor of the government and its supporters , and the file can be closed and not remain open , as is the case now , with no one knowing the truth , whether with regard to the figures for cell phone revenues or with regard to the conditions of tenders and offers .
syria and the lebanese regime that arose out of the al-taif agreement charged most of the political , factional and religious christian players with responsibility for the extensive christian boycott of the representational elections held in 1992 after the chamber of deputies ' 1972 term was extended by around two decades because of civil and other wars which erupted in the country in 1975 .
at the time , the boycott was regarded as a kind of detour from the al-taif agreement , especially by some parties which supported it at that time , and in fact without whose support and sympathy there would have been no light at the end of the tunnel .
it also regarded it as an indication that those mentioned wanted a truce in order to catch their breath and regroup in preparation for a final and decisive battle against the syrian military and political presence in lebanon when the conditions became right .
at the time , syria punished the boycotters by excluding them from the first al-taif government , so to speak , but after reviewing the internal situation in lebanon and its interests in lebanon , and therefore in the region , it gave the green light allowing some of them to be included in the second government .
but the manner in which some of these behaved suggested to damascus that in spite of their agreeing to be involved , and although levels fell , nothing had changed in terms of their strategic position toward syria and its regime in lebanon .
syria was evidently dismayed but did not regard this as a " catastrophe " because christian representation in the al-taif and subsequent governments , as well as in most government institutions , was very reasonable .
on the one hand , there was the prominent northern christian leader , suleiman franjia .
on the other hand , there was the former " leader " of the " lebanese forces , " eli habiqa .
the disastrous official arab system is like a cart spiraling downwards with more and more speed as time passes , without brakes to stop it or even slow it down .
this is the official arabic scene which emerges from the cairo meetings : confusion after confusion from the multitude of foreign " initiatives " closer to colonialist signatures dressed in contemporary tones and armed with a package of " international reports . "
a strong feeling of powerlessness and weakness in the face of arab official resistance ( with the exception of its police and intelligence aspects which are still rebelling ! ) .
the defeat of saddam 's iraq and the invasion of the biggest arab country was a harsh message to the revolutionary arab and the militaria that the time of illusory victories is over and that full bellies do not release people from hopelessness , despair and resorting to violence .
with this , more and more bellies which were full in the past are now empty .
the era of revolution and prosperity , or what is called the era of oil innocence , is over .
president amin al-jamil 's evaluation of the presidential elections differs somewhat from what has been said on the matter in recent weeks . he sees a real opportunity for syria not only to bring about a change in lebanon but also to affirm its desire for broadening the scope of this change so that it is also concerned by it .
his view makes him rule out any american role in the forthcoming lebanese presidential elections , some of the reasons of which he attributes to lebanon no longer being a direct american interest , some to american concern now being focused on a new middle east where reform and democracy reign of which lebanon is only a small detail , and some to american - syrian relations which decree that lebanon should be an item in it .
in spite of this , the former president continues to oppose extending president emile lahud 's term and does not hesitate to correct an old phalangist precept which he believes has been intentionally distorted of late and that is that the phalangist party 's backing of the president of the republic , any president of the republic , has never once lead to backing for renewal or extension of his term in office .
this was the situation with president bashara al-khouri when he was party to the campaign to bring him down in 1952 then with president fuad shahab when he opposed his remaining in power for another term in 1964 .
this is why he sees in clause 49 one of the sources of the lebanese regime 's power since it allows for the rotation of power on a level not common to the arab regimes neighboring lebanon , drowning as they are in dictatorships , and opens the way again to a president who is aware that his term is at an end and so does not continue to commit .
after a solemn national , official and people 's funeral ceremony for martyred president rashid karami in tripoli , a meeting was held at the al karami palace attended by the majority of those who attended the dar al-fatwa meeting with syrian vice - president abdulhalim khaddam who appeared to be angered by the decision issued by the meeting and talked about alacrity " while the martyr 's blood is not yet dry . "
he then turned to al-hus saying : " when you come and see us in damascus , remind me to let you hear a recording which will show you how the assassination attempt was prepared so that you 'll know who the perpetrators are . "
a few days later , al-hus visited damascus accompanied by al-husseini where they met khaddam who , when asked about the promised recording , told al-hus : " would you like to hear about the matter from eli habiqa ? "
al-hus replied : " let me hear it from you . "
khaddam told the story of a meeting involving habiqa and the heads of two security services in al-jamil 's time and members of his staff at the house of a leader of a deputy group and a current deputy who made a special visit to al-hus in 1990 to make it clear he had no involvement in the bombing targeting him .
al-hus tells this story in his book " for truth and history " on pages 53 , 54 and 55 .
is it true that the united states of america is unconcerned by who qualifies for the presidency in lebanon nor with who is chosen as president of the republic , contrary to its attitude in the past ?
the fact is that opinions on this matter vary .
a former foreign minister says the united states of america is no longer concerned with the presidency as it was in the past because the lebanese state is gradually losing its role and its freedom of decision after the al-taif agreement and that this role remains troublesome to syria in various areas , not only in the areas of defense politics , security and foreign affairs but also in terms of internal political affairs in the minutest of its details and in terms of daily political life .
for example , the lebanese state cannot enter into peace negotiations with israel unless the syrian state agrees to this in advance ; it cannot sign a peace agreement if syria does not sign the agreement , it cannot deploy the lebanese army on the israeli border unless this is agreed by syria , it cannot end the role of the lebanese resistance , hizbollah to be specific , even if israel withdraws from all lebanese territory it occupies , unless syria agrees to this .
the inseparability of the lebanese and syrian paths has subjugated everything related to the matter to coordination and agreement between the two countries .
this inseparability means inseparability in path and destiny to the point that the president of lebanon is made in syria and not in lebanon and governments in lebanon are formed with syrian intervention to overcome the obstacles to their formation .
if this is the situation in the lebanese state under conditions which have been in place for over twenty years , and they are abnormal conditions , why should there be any concern about this country 's view since it has no view , the view being that of the syrian state and the final word on every matter being syria 's ?
discussion about the condition of arab women , on international women 's day , is different this year , not because a change has taken place in terms of endorsing their rights and protection , but because these rights are at the forefront of discussions on reforms in the region which not only the west in general is calling for but which many arab regimes are also falling in line with , even though the matter seems at times to be an abrupt discovery for half of society .
but whether the discussion is about the condition of women and their rights as a result of external pressures or other factors , facets of a change have begun but this does not mean the path will not be extremely long and very delicate .
arab women have started to raise their voices ; salutations to all the attendees at the beirut summit on the issue of women and many other meetings in the arab world and another salutation to the sultanate of oman which chose the occasion to appoint a woman , for the first time , to an important ministerial role , the ministry of higher education .
this is a movement and facets which do not negate the fact that the most important method of ending discrimination against women is to introduce laws guaranteeing their rights in various spheres , from home and family to society and work in both the private and public arenas .
this raises the problem of female representation in political life , shameful representation not compensated for by the few exceptions , neither in single party regimes or those who take pride in a degree of democracy such as lebanon .
in this area , the clause specific to female representation in the iraqi interim constitution , signed yesterday , merits a moment of reflection on its usefulness .
