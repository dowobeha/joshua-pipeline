rod larsen : the middle east is " a barrel of gunpowder with a flaming wick . "
oslo 6-2 ( fb ) - terry rod larsen , former united nations envoy to the middle east considers that the situation in the region has never before reached the perilous state it is currently at , likening the region to " a barrel of gunpowder with a flaming wick . "
rod larsen stated , while addressing the public norwegian radio broadcast , nrk , that it is currently possible , in several ways , to liken the region to " a barrel of gunpowder with a flaming wick . "
he added : " i believe the situation is more difficult , complex and dangerous than it was several decades ago . "
among the current or underlying crises in the middle east , rod larsen mentioned the arab - israeli conflict and the iranian nuclear portfolio , as well as the crisis between lebanon and syria .
he stated : " all this leads us back to crucial values and opinions , which render the situation prone at any moment to getting out of control , more so than it was in past days . "
rod larsen omitted frank mention of the acts of violence interspersed with demonstrations in the islamic world , in objection to the publication of caricatures of the prophet mohammed in european newspapers , finding it sufficient to stress the necessity of " dialogue " instead of " casting stones and flaming fire . "
demonstrators burned the buildings of the danish and norwegian embassies in damascus on saturday , while a building housing the danish embassy in beirut was also set ablaze , in response to the publication of the drawings in september in the jyllands posten danish newspaper , and their re - publication later in several modes of the european media , at the forefront of which was the norwegian magazinet .
rod larsen is currently commissioned to oversee the implementation of international security council resolution 1559 , which dictates confiscating the weapons of militias and armed groups in lebanon including , in the view of the council , the lebanese shiite hizballah and palestinian groups .

the work of art bearing the title " the shark " depicts saddam hussein in cuffs swimming in a bowl filled with liquid .
it was to be exhibited during the bauvoir 2006 art festival .
michel landuyt said : " i took into account that ( the work ) would be emotionally shocking " , emphasizing that saddam hussein is currently on trial , the hearings being aired on television .
" the shark " was first exhibited in the prague 2 international exhibition , which is organized every two years and was held between may and september 2005 .

haniyeh announced , following a meeting on monday evening with the head of egyptian intelligence , major - general omar suleiman : " we will meet with them ( the fatah movement ) and officially invite them to take part in this government . "
in announcements , reported by the official egyptian middle east news press agency , he added : " we will await the official response to be issued by leading institutions of the fatah movement . "
several fatah leaders expressed their objection to participating in the government , which will presumably be formed by hamas , however no official decision has yet been issued by fatah on this front .
haniyeh said : " we assured omar suleiman that hamas has an interest in consulting with all palestinian political parties and we spoke of international pressures and threats to cut aid to the palestinian people . "
he added : " we stressed that all these stances are unjust to our people , but we have alternatives , at all levels , palestinian , arab and islamic . "
he continued : " we also spoke of ways to revive the role of the palestinian liberation organization , considering that the parliamentary elections are the first step and will be followed by a second step relating to palestinians in the diaspora . "
on monday , a delegation from hamas commenced talks in cairo on the formation of the new palestinian government , after the leadership of the movement held two meetings with suleiman , with plans to meet him once more today , tuesday .

head of the internal israeli security service warns of a threat of " jewish terrorism " .
jerusalem 7-2 ( fb ) head of the internal israeli security service ( shin bet ) yuval diskin warned of the risks of " jewish terrorism " , during a meeting with young settlers in the west bank , aired by channel two of israeli television on monday night .
diskin told students at a religious institute for semi - military training : " i say to you in all candor , if a jew carries out an act of terrorism , it will spread like cancer in the state , and will pose a much more serious danger than hamas " , in an allusion to the islamic resistance movement .
diskin made these announcements about a month ago , but his speech , recorded a month ago , was not aired till monday night , on israeli channel " ten " .
he added : " i assure you that we will as harshly pursue any jewish terrorist killing arabs as we do any arab terrorist killing jews . " but he admitted that an arab will receive " harsher treatment than that received by a jew for committing the same deeds . "
he expressed grave concern over the " tendency towards extremism " amongst youth settlers who are carried away with violence in expressing their objection to evacuating settlements .
on the other hand , diskin declared that the toppling of iraqi president saddam hussein 's regime was , after all , " detrimental to israel " , because anarchy " pervaded iraq " .
tens of thousands of settlers and supporters of the radical right protested on sunday night in west jerusalem under the banner " olmert is detrimental to jews " in reference to the acting prime minister .
one banner bore the slogan " olmert leads us to civil war " referring to demolition of nine homes built in the illegal outpost of amona , near ramallah in the west bank .
during the evacuation operation , clashes took place between settlers and policemen , which resulted in the injury of two hundred people , most of whom sustained light injuries .

commander sayyid masoud al-jazairi , in his statements on wednesday , mentioned that " in her childish dreams , merkel sees herself as hitler and thinks , now that she holds the position of chancellor , she can dictate her orders to the world and to the free countries " .
in a statement broadcasted by the iranian students news agency , the director of public affairs department for the revolutionary guards added " we ca n't expect better from people who have a zionist past " .

hamas refuses what members of fatah consider endangering palestinian national plan
by : taher al-majthoub
( repetition with clarification in the fourth paragraph )
ramallah ( west bank ) february 8 ( afp ) . certain circles in the fatah movement have expressed their concern about the palestinian national plan being in danger , with the advent of the hamas islamic resistance movement into palestinian government , yet the islamic movement strongly rejects this suggestion .
adnan al-damiri , one of fatah 's leaders in the west bank , stressed to agence france press that " hamas , as part of the muslim brotherhood all over the world , is not concerned with the regional issue of the palestinian government as much as the national issue of islam " .
he also said " the other aspect is that hamas is a resistance movement which can be compared with the taliban and chechnya movements and this is a quality distinguishing it from other islamic movements in the arab and muslim world , but hamas has not performed operations outside the borders of palestine . "
al-damiri , who nominated himself on behalf of the fatah movement in the last elections but was n't successful , considered that the difference between hamas and fatah is that " fatah has a program for striving to negotiate for the establishment of the palestinian government in the west bank and gaza strip with east jerusalem as its capital in line with the borders of 1967 . fatah considers this a strategic solution while hamas sees it as temporary . "
similarly , a palestinian official who refused to reveal his identity emphasized that hamas " is a part of the islamic expansionism which does n't care about establishing a regional government as much as it cares about establishing the islamic caliphate . hence , its interests might interfere with those of tehran and damascus and it is nominated to ally with hezbollah in lebanon and iran and the muslim brotherhood in any of the world 's countries " .
he added " syria might also make use of it in the framework of continuing its policies which aspire to make use of the palestinian and lebanese issues as a means of pressuring israel , especially since the baath party considers the regional issue as dualism with respect to arab nationalism . "
hence , if hamas agrees to make peace with israel for 10 or 15 years , it might go back on the idea of liberation and concentrate on imposing the islamic plan on society as he said .
more than one official in hamas has affirmed that the islamic movement , which is getting ready to establish the new palestinian government , is willing to enter a long truce with israel .
in a talk with france press , hamas ' deputy mahmoud al-rumhi strongly denied that hamas might be exposing the national palestinian plan to danger .
he also said " these allegations have no basis in truth and the one - sided policy of israel started before hamas ' success . that was when the fatah movement was in power because the oslo agreements ( 1994 ) did not determine when settlement ends nor did it specify the limits of the palestinian government " and thus the movement does n't hold any responsibility in exposing the palestinian plan to danger .
he also added that israel , in its same - one sided policy , decided to " retreat from the gaza strip and build the separating wall before the victory of hamas , before the date of the elections was decided and before the decision of hamas to participate in them " affirming that israel does not respect any of the signed treaties and negotiating wo n't stop that , and the only solution is to continue to resist .
director of the hamas movement 's politburo announced on wednesday that the movement might adhere to a long truce with israel if they retreat to the borders of 1967 and acknowledge palestinian rights .
al-rumhi said " the truce with its conditions , which are establishment of a palestinian government within the borders of 1967 along with east jerusalem and setting prisoners free " , emphasizing that " if we are unable to have these conditions met , israel does n't let out any prisoner and it does n't retreat from the west bank , then hamas is going to back out of the settlement which it agreed upon in the cairo agreement " .
as for ahmad saadat , secretary - general of the popular front for the liberation of palestine , spoke to france press from his prison in ariha : " we do not fear any palestinian party letting go of the palestinian plan because the battle , from the start , is with the occupying israelis and we did not hear the hamas movement abandoning the palestinian issue 's invariables under any banner or program " .
he emphasized that " clinging onto these invariables and fighting occupation are common denominators " and " resistance is linked to the presence of occupation " .
saadat added " we await that which hamas is going to put forward , and what is required of all powers of the palestinian society is a democratic view and internal agreement as the first part of electing the members of parliament and the second part must consist of the direct participation of our citizens abroad in the elections " .
it indicates that both the popular front and hamas reject the oslo agreements and the road map plan .
bassam al-salihi , the member of parliament for the alternative parliamentary cluster ( the people 's party - leftist ) also considered that " it is too early to come up with general or hasty conclusions for many reasons , one of them being that the victory of hamas does n't necessarily mean the loss of political balance in a definite way " .
yet he requested a " careful look at the results of the elections because the support of hamas amongst the palestinian public does n't exceed half the voters , 40% " , adding , " i believe the liberation & independence organization , international rights and the arab peace initiative make up the majority amongst the palestinian public " .
al-salihi said " it is very hard for any political party to reach any agreement short of this program " .
al-salihi indicated that his front " is thinking of presenting a plan in parliament or the central council of the liberation organization to announce the 1967 border as those of the palestinian government with jerusalem as its capital and asking the world to accept this ... ( because the issue of the border is n't an issue of negotiation , but an issue of battle ) " .
al-salihi affirmed that " we now believe that the first mission is reconstructing the palestinian democratic movement on a clearer basis in both its political and social aspects . the basis is the independence document because it outlines a social view for the political government built on a secular system " .
suzuki soon to announce future in world rally championship
tokyo , february 8 ( afp ) . the japanese company , suzuki , assured that it will soon announce its plans in terms of whether it will participate in the world rally championship or not , without revealing any related details about this issue .
david farkohar , media and public relations department director in the japanese company , revealed that the announcement will be made towards the end of the geneva car exhibition at the end of this month .
many in world rally championship circles are discussing that suzuki might join the official manufacturing family starting from next year , keeping in mind that it currently participates in the junior wrc , driving the swift s1600 and earned the swedish rally title , the first stage of this championship and the second stage from the wrc championship with its swedish driver pierre gonar anderson .
suzuki participated in many rallies , outside these two divisions , which constitutes its preparation for possible entry to the higher division in the championship . its advertisement today about making the decision in regard to this matter on the 28th of this month ( at 2 o'clock geneva time ) is what backs up these predictions .
in case it does decide to participate , that will be a great promotion for the championship , especially after the withdrawal of the two french companies citroen , the world champion for the past 3 years and peugeot , as well as japanese mitsubishi , czech skoda and korean hyundai from official racing .
citroen will return to the championship next year with a new car " c4 " instead of casara , keeping in mind that it will be semi - officially promoting the belgian company cronos rising ( citroen casara ) and its drivers the french sebastian lob , world champion for the last two years , and his spanish fellow cazavieh bonz as well as promoting its citizen daniel sordo , junior wrc champion last year who is following in the footsteps of lob himself who was crowned with the championship for this division before moving to the higher division .
the number of official manufacturers in the championship will increase to 4 , if suzuki participates and citroen returns next year , as well as subaru and ford who won first and second place in this year 's championship with its new finnish driver marcos grownholme . while other participations in the " special division " are limited , as is the case with the finnish tony gardmyster ( astra racing - peugeot 307 ) who was absent from the swedish rally after reaching third place in monaco , french jill banitzi ( red bull - skoda ) and italian gigi ghaly who participates at his own expense ( mitsubishi lancer w the 2005 model ) .
israeli secretary considers putin 's invitation for hamas " stab in back " .
jerusalem february 10 ( afp ) . today , friday , israeli education secretary meir sheetrit considered the invitation of the russian president vladimir putin for hamas to visit moscow as an " actual stab in the back " of israel .
the secretary , in a statement to the public israeli radio station , said that " this initiative is certainly a stab in the back ( . . . ) because the purpose behind it is granting international legitimacy to a terrorist group and we must oppose it with every means " .
the secretary continued " how would moscow react if we sent an invitation to the representatives of chechnya to visit jerusalem ? " .
sheetrit added " russia , which does not allow free elections in chechnya cannot give us moral lessons about the legitimacy of hamas after the elections " .
on his part , housing secretary zeev boim said in a press conference : " putin is playing with fire " , declaring the stance of russia to be " very worrying " .
a top - level israeli official expressed israel 's great displeasure at the latest russian stance on thursday night . he said " when the chechnyans carry out an attack in moscow , russia considers it a terrorist act , but the situation is not the same when it happens in jerusalem " , in reference to the tens of suicide operations which hamas carried out throughout the decade .
on thursday , from madrid , putin declared that he is " soon " going to invite officials from hamas to moscow in order to hold discussions about the future of the peace process between israel and the palestinians .
putin whose country does n't include hamas in its classification of " terrorist organizations " , recently considered that the european union would be committing a " big mistake " by deciding to cut off financial aid to the palestinians .
the russian president emphasized that hamas got to power following democratic elections and " it is essential to respect the decision of the palestinian people " .
changes in al-atri 's cabinet and al-shara , vice president , commissioned to oversee foreign affairs
by : nasib azar
damascus , february 11 ( afp ) . today , saturday , syrian president bashar al-asad issued 3 decrees for a cabinet reshuffle , bringing in 14 new secretaries to government . changes were also introduced specifically to the positions related to foreign affairs , coinciding with the external pressure campaign of which syria has been suffering for more than a year .
according to the first decree , foreign secretary , farouq al-shara , was appointed " vice president , overseeing the implementation of media and foreign policies " .
the second decree introduced changes in mohammed naji al-atri 's cabinet and accordingly brought in 14 new secretaries to the government in sensitive positions like foreign affairs , internal affairs and media . in accordance with this , walid al-muallim was appointed as foreign secretary after being deputy to foreign secretary farouq al-shara .
as for the third decree , it dictated the appointment of syria 's representative at the united nations , faisal al-miqdad , as deputy foreign secretary replacing al-muallim .
the cabinet reshuffle did not include the prime ministership which remained under the leadership of secretary mohammad naji al-atri , while general bassam abdul majid was appointed as secretary of the interior instead of ghazi canaan who committed suicide on the 12th of last october .
general abdul hamid was chief of military police in syria since 2002 , and before that an intelligence official for the southern syrian region , and born in al-qunaitra in 1950 .
in the media department , mahdi dakhl allah was dropped and replaced with mohsen belal who was the syrian ambassador in spain for many years and a professor at damascus university .
sufyan alaw was appointed as the oil & mineral resources secretary replacing ibrahim haddad , and ghiyath barakat as the higher education secretary replacing hani murtada .
defense secretary hassan turkmani remained in his position , also buthaina shaaban remained as immigration secretary , mohammed al-hussein as treasury secretary and amir husni lutfi as economy and trade secretary .
joseph swede was appointed secretary of state , and he is the first member of the national social syrian party to be appointed as a secretary ever since the party joined the national front in 2005 .
the baath party obtained al-asad 's share in the government , so they took over 19 departments including the prime ministership , while 7 secretaries were appointed from 7 different parties represented in the national progressive front , in addition to 7 retired secretaries .
the national progressive front encompasses an assembly of 10 parties , on top of them is the baath party .
all 9 parties are usually represented in the national front except the baath party , which is represented in the government , but the current cabinet reshuffle left two parties without representation and they are the arab socialist union party led by safwan qudsi and the federal socialist movement led by ghassan abdul aziz othman .
the parties of the other front were represented by 6 secretaries of state , while the communist party obtained the irrigation secretariat represented by yousef al-faisal .
this cabinet reshuffle was n't surprising since it had been spoken of ever since the suicide of ghazi canaan , who freed the position with his death on the 12th of last october .
these cabinet reshuffles coincide with the international pressure campaign which syria is experiencing on backdrop of the investigation into the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik al-hariri when two reports from the international investigation panel indicated the involvement of lebanese & syrian intelligence agents in the assassination .
also , the united states accused syria of making it easy for arab fighters to enter iraq through the syrian land .
yemeni president cabinet reshuffle following escape of 23 al-qaeda militants
by : hamoud monser
sana , february 11 ( afp ) - yemen news agency ( saba ' ) has reported that yemeni president ali abdullah saleh announced a cabinet reshuffle today , saturday , following the escape of 23 supposed al-qaeda members from a yemeni prison last week .
the yemeni president decided to keep prime minister abdel qader as head of government and sack defense minister abdullah ali eleiwa and 15 other ministers .
the yemeni president also sacked the two deputy prime ministers eleiwi al-salami and ahmed soufa who held the finance and planning portfolios respectively .
interior minister rashad al-aleemi has kept his portfolio and become the only deputy prime minister .
brigadier general mohammed nasser ahmed ali has also been appointed as defense secretary .
the outgoing government was formed in may 2003 following the victory of the general people 's congress ruling party in parliamentary elections .
the cabinet reshuffle follows criticism leveled at the yemeni government , especially by the us , following the escape of 23 so - called al-qaeda militants from a prison run by yemeni intelligence in sana last saturday .
among the militants that broke out of a jail in sana , were 13 al-qaeda members , two of which were convicted for the bombings of the uss cole and the french supertanker limburg , including jamal al-badawi , who was serving a 10 year sentence for the bombing of the uss cole in 2000 , which killed 17 american soldiers .
the yemeni authorities carried out a campaign to hunt down the fugitives and arrested about 95 of their relatives in an attempt to force them to surrender .
the prisoners managed to flee the prison by digging a 44 - meter long tunnel connecting their cell with a nearby mosque . the diameter of the tunnel was no bigger than 70 centimeters .
marine ships of the coalition , led by the us , which roam the regional waters of yemen , took part in the hunt for the 23 fugitives . at the same time the interpol ( international police ) released an international alert about their escape .
yemen is the ancestral homeland of the family of osama bin laden , leader of al-qaeda , which claimed responsibility for the attack .
since the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks against the us , yemen has worked closely with washington to uproot those suspected of supporting al-qaeda in yemen .
on the other hand , a yemeni court rejected today , saturday , the appeal filed by three jailed al-qaeda members , amongst them one of the prison - breakers who was convicted of carrying out attacks against western targets in the gulf states .

saddam hussein entered the courtroom wearing a blue gown and a black jacket . as he entered he was saying " down with the traitors , down with the traitors , down with bush , long live the nation , long live the nation , long live the nation " .
the former president told the judge that he was forced to enter the courtroom .
then ensued a state of disorder when the accused objected about being brought to the courtroom by force . birzan ibrahim al-tikriti , saddam hussein 's step - brother , yelled at the judge , raouf rashid abdul rahman , saying " you have nothing to do with mercy and such names . you are not praised or compassionate , you are a military commander , not a judge , we do n't want to sit here in this place " .
he added " i ca n't continue this trial hearing while my personal lawyer is absent " .
he continued to say that he is plagued with " a disease that has no cure . medical examinations were carried out on me by the americans in the american camp , for that reason you must set me free so i can seek medication . the law dictates the importance of setting free any accused person who suffers from an incurable disease . i am dying slowly , you are killing me " .
when the judge informed him that the court has agreed to present him to a medical team , he said " if you fear allah , set me free so i may seek medication amongst my family and i will sign any pledge to attend the trials . i have a matter of honor and i want to go and defend my honor " .
he continued " if you imagine that the baath party needs me , then know that the baath party is operating very well and does n't need me or others . here is its secretary - general ( he pointed at saddam hussein ) , he 's been in prison for two years , so set me free so i can seek medication " .
the judge replied " you have spoken a lot and wasted much of the court 's time " , barzan interrupted him saying " i have the right to speak from now till tomorrow " .
after that , barzan al-tikriti noticed that the judge ignored his demands to be set free , so he left his seat , sat on the floor and turned his back at the judge ignoring the court hearing .
saddam , who looked angry , swore at the judge , while holding the qur'an in his hand , because of being compelled to attend the hearing . he said " this is the practice of traitors , allah is great and may the lowlifes be driven away . damn your whiskers ! "
he added " this is not a court hearing , this is a game "
saddam told the judge " it is not your right to appoint lawyers for us instead of our lawyers with all due respect to them , because they agreed to defend us ; my respect to every iraqi " .
the judge explained that " the court appointed alternative lawyers from the defense team according to iraqi law after the defense lawyers boycotted the hearings " . saddam replied : " they did n't boycott the hearings , it was you who kicked them out and some of them were even being hit in front of you " .
judge abdul rahman replied " i do not permit you to speak of political matters " .
saddam interrupted him " you are ignorant , what politics ? you are working in a selective way against the law "
the legal proceedings then began with the reading of statements from a number of witnesses who mentioned what they experienced under the security system after being captured in 1982 .
saddam hussein interfered , telling the court 's president " when the witnesses speak of politics it is allowed , but when saddam hussein and his assistants speak about political matters it is not " .
saddam hussein , his former assistants and defense team boycotted the tenth hearing which took place on february 8 , when they left the hearing , which was preceded by an argument with the new judge who became the private court 's president , raouf rashid abdul rahman .
on sunday , the lawyer khalil al-duleimi , director of saddam hussein 's defense team , announced to agence france press in a telephone call " as director of the defense team , i can affirm that no one from the defense team or the accused will attend the court hearing today " .
jaafar al-mousawi , district attorney of the court , declared that " the court will convene a meeting before the court hearing to look into the possibility of bringing the accused by force or leaving them , if they insist on not attending " .
he found that " in case the court made a decision , it must be carried out regardless of its nature " .
saddam and his assistants have been on trial since last october in the matter of the killing of 148 villagers in the shiite village of al-dejail , in retaliation for an attack targeting the former iraqi president 's escort during his visit to the village in 1982 .

solana declined to answer directly in regards to such legislations but said he did n't see " any difficulty in terms of agreement to such a clause if it is within the principles of the human rights commission which is on its way to formation now .
this commission will replace the present committee , which is based in geneva . it will review its values and credibility to a large extent . then it appeared that its modus operandi has permitted for countries non - compliant with human rights , to be represented amongst its ranks .
solana declared on wednesday that he is going to visit many countries in the region , among them saudi arabia , to ease the anger engulfing the islamic world , in the wake of the publication of these pictures .

and he added : " let us put this matter behind us and work together with them to prevent this from happening again . "
these degrading caricatures were published for the first time in a danish newspaper , last september , before being reproduced in many european ones , in the name of the freedom of expression .

iran confirms it will go ahead with uranium enrichment ( conclusion )
by siafoush ghazi :
tehran , february 14 ( afp ) - tehran has confirmed today , tuesday , the resumption of uranium enrichment in the natnaz facility , refusing to suspend " its research " in this area , while european countries have set the suspension of this activity as a condition to start negotiations with tehran on its nuclear program . "
jawad waeedi , member of the higher council of national security , who is in charge of the nuclear portfolio confirmed that " activities have started " in the natnaz uranium enrichment facility ( middle ) . "
tehran announced on monday the removal of seals and the surveillance cameras installed by the international atomic energy agency at the natnaz facility .
diplomatic sources at the headquarters of the international atomic energy agency in vienna announced that iran resumed enrichment activities at that facility .
but waeedi refused to comment on the statements that iranians have started the actual process of uranium enrichment by feeding uranium hexafluorure gas into centrifuges .
he told journalists following an address to the students of a tehran islamic association " i ca n't provide you with answers for these technical issues . " he also confirmed " it is not acceptable that we stop our research " stating that " uranium enrichment is the essence of the nuclear program . "
the actual resumption of uranium enrichment resulted in a dead end in the dialogue with europeans last august and later last january after it had been resumed last december .
those countries adopted a resolution on february 4th at the international atomic energy agency demanding iran to suspend all its sensitive activities and informed the un security council of the iranian portfolio .
but instead of compliance , iran responded by announcing the termination of the tight monitoring program implemented by the international atomic energy agency on its nuclear program and large - scale resumption of all activities that were put on hold , namely those relating to enrichment .
the natnaz facility comprises two enrichment units ; one of them is a project focusing on research and the other is an industrial plant under construction .
as for this unit , waeedi stated iran " needs time to upgrade its industrial capabilities to 60 centrifuges to enrich uranium , but have started our activities . " he added his country does n't " find any need at present to suspend yet again " its activities in that facility .
waeedi justified the unilateral steps his country had taken on the basis that " after displaying good intentions for the last three years , europeans have demanded the full abandonment of the nuclear fuel circle . "
europeans are particularly against the idea of iran 's enrichment on its soil because iran has failed to prove that the nuclear program has purely civil aims .
the enrichment process is necessary to get fuel for nuclear stations but can also be used to manufacture nuclear weapons .
it is expected the international atomic energy agency will convene again on the 6th of march to determine whether iran has complied with its demands and most probably make a decision to report iran to the un security council .
meanwhile , an iranian delegation will be visiting russia on the 20th of february , as waeedi said , to discuss russia 's suggestion for iran to enrich uranium on russian soil .
but this suggestion depends on the iranians ' stance who are enriching uranium in their country , something western countries do n't approve of .

rice confesses mistakes american administration committed while rebuilding iraq
washington , february 16 ( afp ) . today , thursday , during a congress hearing , the american foreign secretary , condoleezza rice , was forced to confess to some mistakes committed by the american administration in the field of rebuilding iraq .
after kent conrad , democratic senator of north dakota , showered her with questions about the results of the reconstruction program on which the united states spent more than 20 billion dollars , rice was forced to confess two of the american administration 's mistakes . one of them concerned with training the iraqi forces and the second with the infrastructure .
the secretary , who was testifying in front of the senate 's budget committee , said the number of iraqi security services now reached 227 thousand members " .
she clarified that " to be honest , we made a mistake at first when we relied on quantity , not quality . the members now available are qualified " .
in her speech about the united states carrying out " the development of a big portion of infrastructure " , especially at the level of drinking water and water filtering , rice confessed , under the pressure of the senate 's questions , that the number of iraqis who have access to drinking water and drainage systems is less than it was before the war .
she added " you are right , we concentrated our efforts on reinforcing capabilities to provide these services " and not on networks for drawing and purifying local water .
conrad replied , saying " we can reinforce the capabilities and that is very good , but what concerns the people at the end of the day is having these services " .
strange laws adding humor to england
by : jalal malti .
london , february 17 ( afp ) : england has an old set of laws and customs , some are strange and others funny . they still apply , even if not imposed , but in any case their humor amazes law students .
among these laws , one dating back to the year 1279 indicates that it is forbidden for parliament members to wear armor inside parliament . the aim of this law was to avoid fights and confrontations leading to killings , among the lords in a country with ancient democratic customs .
also , among these strange laws , is one which forbids members of parliament to die in westminster castle , and if this happened it was a duty to carry the body out of parliament , before issuing a death certificate .
nigel cawthorne , author of the book entitled " the strange laws of old england " displayed these amazing texts , overridden with time , and clarified that this law 's meaning was that " the castle of westminster is a royal castle and whoever dies in a royal castle is entitled to an official funeral " .
members of parliament have the right to gamble and drink alcohol in total freedom in westminster , its library inclusive , while their citizens are fined for similar behavior , as per the law of violations in libraries ( 1898 ) .
in total , more than four thousand national laws , eleven thousand local laws and thirteen thousand special laws , going back to before 1801 , still apply in england .
cawthorne said to france press " that the tradition of the law is very important " in england , clarifying that " things are changing but at a very slow pace and laws are piled up one onto the other " .
the fact is that members have enacted laws for many aspects of daily life , including its very ordinary aspects , and in the 19th century , at the height of the industrial revolution , they enacted a number of laws , aiming to organize life in the suburbs .
for instance , this caution led to the prohibition against hanging laundry in the streets , singing lascivious songs , firing guns without justification , lighting a fire in the garden , playing with paper airplanes , skating on ice , tapping on the doors of residents without justification , switching on public lights " willingly and in an illegal fashion " , and other laws which became a laughing matter in our days .
some of these laws are not enacted any more and have n't been since long ago , due to the progress which has taken place since their issuing , and the funniest of them is : a law forbidding you to ride a horse or a cow , or to ride in a steam car when drunk ( 1872 ) .
a law dating back to the year 1867 forbids " all those living within a distance of one mile from an arms or explosives depot " - of owning a deck of playing cards . and a law issued in the year 1839 , dictates punishment to whoever fires a cannon in the vicinity of a house .
kevin martin , head of the legal assembly in charge of proposing laws which should be abolished , said : " these extraordinary examples represent the ancient history of traditional law in this country , as they prove the ongoing need to modify laws and adapt them to reality " .
more than two thousand legal clauses have been abolished since the year 1965 , in a large - scale mission to modify laws .
but british deputies still continue to enact strange laws , such as " the law of outer space " ( 1986 ) , which cautions any british citizen against throwing any entity into space " without official authorization ; space being limited to include the moon and all other celestial bodies . "
wisdom has dictated that they empower judges to issue orders for " the use of a reasonable amount of force " to confront a possible alien invasion .
sunni imam warns against celebrating valentine 's day
baghdad , february 17 ( afp ) . three days after valentine 's day , a sunni imam , in his friday sermon , waged an attack on valentine 's day and those celebrating it in iraq , saying that " it takes young people away from virtuousness to vice " .
today , friday , most imams of mosques in iraq concentrated in their sermons on the photos of abuse of detainees which date back to 2004 , while others concentrated on poor services and the difficulty of the security situation in the country . except that sheik mahmoud al-sumeidaai , imam of um al-qura mosque , concentrated on valentine 's day which the world celebrates on the 14th of this month , saying he considered it to have no relation with islam .
he said " valentine 's day passed by , 2 or 3 days ago , and unfortunately a lot of our male and female youth do on this day what pleases the enemy , they exchange gifts and words , and it reaches the extent of exchanging kisses , this is how our enemies want us to live , away from virtue " .
valentine 's day is a very popular day in iraq , like any other country in the world , where young men exchange candy , flowers , perfume and other gifts with their beloved ones .
al-sumeidaai added that " every invasion has a goal and the invasion of our country targets our youth , dragging them away from virtue to vice " .
the history of celebrating this day in iraq goes back to well before the american invasion in 2003 ; a great celebration used to be held on this occasion during the rule of deposed president saddam hussein , and the national television channel used to broadcast special programs on this occasion .
it is mentioned that the iraqi president 's son , uday , was known for holding very big celebrations on valentine 's in the hunting club 's halls in the high class al-mansour neighborhood , which used to last till the early hours of the morning .
al-sumeidaai said that " valentine 's was not mentioned by islam and muslims are supposed to live according to their religion " .
berlusconi makes deal with italian radical right
rome , february 17 ( afp ) : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi signed today , friday , 6 weeks ahead of parliamentary elections , a political agreement with the neo - fascist movement " the social alternative " headed by alessandra mussolini , granddaughter of fascist dictator benito mussolini .
berlusconi stated , in the presence of alessandra mussolini , " we 've reached an agreement on the house house of liberties coalition between the ( ruling coalition ) and the social alternative " signaling the expansion of his electoral coalition with the radical right .
the alliance with the social alternative , in preparation for the forthcoming elections in april , angered the rest of berlusconi 's allies because of some controversial members of the neo - fascist radical right in this coalition .
berlusconi stressed " our family photo album is idealistic , it 's snow white . "
a solution was reached when alessandra mussolini and her annoying allies roberto fiore forza nuova ( the new force ) and adriano tilgher , leader of the national social front , decided not to personally run in the list of " the house of liberties " and recommended other candidates .
massimo dalema , president of the leftist democrats , the largest opposition party , stated today , friday , " it 's very dangerous for berlusconi to sign agreements with the neo - fascist radical right . "
ignazio la russa , parliamentary leader of the right wing national alliance , successor of the neo - fascist movement and the second party in berlusconi 's coalition , stressed that despite the decision of the leaders of " the social alternative " not to run for elections , the main problem lies in sharing essential values and political vision . "
alessandra mussolini 's party calls for rejecting turkey 's request to join the european union , rejecting the european detention bill and abortion laws , and calls for deporting migrants and signing a new agreement with the catholic church condemning " american imperialism " .
muslims biggest victims of terrorism committed in name of islam ( belgian study )
brussels , february 17 ( afp ) . a new study carried out by belgian researchers , entitled " development of terrorism in 2005 " stated that muslims are the greatest victims of terrorism committed in the name of islam and that international terrorism is striking the middle east more than the west .
from another angle , the study showed that 90% of international terrorism victims in 2005 fell in iraq and jordan .
this study was carried out under the leadership of rick colsat , international relations professor at ghan university in west belgium , and was published online the " economy " governmental website .
according to the study , the number of international terrorist operations decreased significantly in 2005 compared with 2004 , with 266 attacks carried out , leading to 443 casualties in 2004 while 393 attacks were carried out in 2005 which led to 733 victims .
the study tells that terrorism is n't a danger having a comprehensive nature because it is mainly located in one region , which is the middle east .
on the other hand , " local " terrorism , which is performed by citizens of a country against targets in their own country , witnessed a great increase between 2004 and 2005 , where attacks increased by 90% while victims increased by 60% .
the study indicated that this increase is mostly a result of the situation in iraq .
it also claimed that " the conflict in iraq , which came about as a cause in the war on terror , led to making iraq a center for terrorism today " .
rick colsat , in reference to these statistics , said in a telephone call " imagine how the islamic world looks at these statistics while the west insists that they are the ones under threat " by terrorism .
the study also revealed that " the facts do n't confirm the idea that international terrorism poses a fundamental external threat " .
in the same context , colsat said that " jihadist terrorism does not make up the existential danger which we believe it to , even if it poses a challenge for our societies " .
this study , which is the second of its kind , based itself on information gathered from the famous american rand corporation foundation , the national memorial for protection from terrorism foundation and its information bank specialized in terrorism .
berlusconi finds difficulty in dismissing secretary accused of insulting islam
by : christian spielman
rome , february 18 ( afp ) . today , saturday , italian prime minister , silvio berlusconi , got into a conflict with his allies in the leftist wing in order to be able to dismiss one of their leaders , the reform secretary roberto calderoli , aiming at calming the tensions which his anti - islamic statements arouse in the islamic world .
the prime minister asked calderoli to resign , simultaneously emphasizing today , saturday , that " he does not have any power to force him " to do so .
the intended secretary replied by saying that he is willing to resign if ( umberto bossi ) , ( the leftist wing leader ) asked him to and if the islamic world carried out a peaceful initiative " .
the italian secretary is accused of insulting islam by wearing a t - shirt , carrying the offensive cartoons of the character of prophet mohammed , which caused dangerous international conflict . he was wearing the t - shirt on thursday and appeared in it during the evening news program on the italian first channel " rai " .
these initiatives and more anti - islamic accusations which he stated in a press conference on friday , led to violent protests against italy in libya and the death of 10 people on friday .
roberto calderoli has no intention of apologizing . today , saturday , the courier de la sierra newspaper related that he said " i do n't feel responsible for those who were killed " .
he emphasized in a statement to a la republica newspaper that " the western culture is the threatened one " .
silvio berlusconi aroused great shock in the islamic world when he affirmed " the superiority of western culture " on the 26th of september 2001 , two weeks after the attacks on the united states . he faced many difficulties in rectifying the consequences of these statements .
calderoli ( 49 years of age ) , who is a former specialist in jaw and face surgery , is considered to be one of the extremists in the leftist wing , the anti - foreigner movement and an ally of berlusconi .
he joined the government in july 2004 , taking the place of bossi , the wing 's leader who was forced to resign due to cardiovascular problems . the wing is in charge of 3 departments which are the justice , labor and reform departments .
roberto calderoli affirmed that he enjoys the support of umberto bossi and his party besides " the support of many italians who think like me " .
he boasted to la republica newspaper " silvio berlusconi asked for my resignation but i have n't resigned yet " .
the italian government fears the uprising of new protests today , saturday , against italy in the islamic world , let alone the reactions in italy .
berlusconi stated that he asked the interior secretary , giuseppe pisanu , to provide surveillance on the leftist wing offices and emphasized that " all protection procedures have been taken to guarantee the security of italian delegations abroad " .
as for the italian foreign secretary , gianfranco fini , he announced his determination on visiting the mosque of rome today , in an attempt to calm tensions which calderoli 's statements instigated .
this is not the first time in which the prime minister has an encounter with the leftist wing , asking for the resignation of one of its secretaries from government .
in july , 2003 , he had to negotiate with umberto bossi about dismissing the travel secretary 's representative , stefano stefani , who made offensive statements about german tourists .
the encounter lasted for a week and caused a crisis in diplomatic relations with germany , which was from the start offended by insults silvio berlusconi had personally directed to a german member of parliament , describing him as a nazi camp guard .
this new crisis comes at a critical time for the prime minister who is drowning in a tough legislative election campaign confirmed for the 29th of april . maurizio gaspari , a leader in the national coalition ( right wing ) , said that the crisis " came at a time when we were starting to improve our position , according to polls " .

with events , solana caught between intellect and emotions . by : nour el-deen ashour .
the current tour of the foreign policy envoy of the european union , khafyer solana , does n't pose any question about the possibilities of its success , as much as it turns to the question of whether he resorted to his intellect or emotions when he volunteered to attempt to calm the islamic public 's reaction after many european newspapers published cartoons insulting the prophet .
since solana is now in the middle east , it seems he resorted to his emotions , after being hurt by the publishing of the cartoons and felt what muslims feel due to the insults that reached them in the name of freedom of speech , while he did n't hesitate to announce that " as the european union , we have a great deal of respect for muslims ...
... and we do n't want to hurt their feelings " .
this is part of what the european official said after recently meeting the secretary general of the islamic conference organization .
" if the foreign policy envoy was given the option ( and this is only an assumption ) to resort to his intellect , he would n't have troubled himself by coming to the middle east , whether to apologize or to convince . the crisis would have been rectified in a european context since denmark is a member of the european union and its economical interests are under threat ...
is it reasonable that anyone would rush to the oppressed , in order to calm down and relieve , before condemning the oppressor and making them understand that what they did was unacceptable ?
was hitler given full freedom , during war world ii , to execute his aggressive plans and racist ideologies just so the allies would be content with consoling the european peoples including the jews ?
the gravest danger posed by this matter is there being attempts to convince muslims of the appropriateness of european conformity , which has n't yet abolished the medium of free speech in connection to publishing the cartoons . this does not solve the crisis ; in fact there are those who pay with their lives in protest against the cartoons and so europe would have succeeded in accomplishing two things . first , dissolving the issue and keeping it in the framework of freedom of speech . second , exporting the crisis to islamic countries causing chaos and violence .
for that reason , solana 's transformation into a man of good aspirations towards the islamic world shows that the european union has n't understood the feelings of muslims who do n't deny freedom of speech , but do n't want it to be a method of arousing hatred and violating religious sentiments ...
when we hear of the issuing of a european , followed by an international , law which makes it a crime to attack other religions and insult sanctified entities , only then will the efforts of solana be praised indeed .
al-akhdar al-ibrahimi and iraq 's mandela : by asia al-atrous .
because acknowledgement of failure and admission of defeat have never found their way to the dictionary of international diplomacy in general , and arab diplomacy in particular , especially where the war on iraq is concerned , or in terms of the incidents , events and secrets which revolved around it and still do , and which will probably not be discovered for a long period of time , what was declared by experienced algerian diplomat , al-akhdar al-ibrahimi , regarding his " mission impossible " in iraq , merits attention and calls for a serious pause .
and because al-akhdar al-ibrahimi might be the only arab maghreb diplomat willing to take on the adventure up close , and carry out a dangerous mission , both on a personal level , and on that of his movement to an arab country subject to occupation and ruin . it was very natural , in the context of the dangerous developments seen on the iraqi scene , during the past two and a half years , for his mission to invite many comments about the causes and motives which can move a man of such a stature and expertise as al-ibrahimi to accept involvement in a role , under the american occupation authorities ' control , knowing that he was clear in his stance , since the beginning , not advocating the decision to go to war , which was taken outside the framework of international legitimacy . previously , al-akhdar al-ibrahimi tied up the success of his mission in south africa , during the apartheid era , to the presence of a leader such as mandela , capable of creating the committee of truth and reconciliation and regrouping his people around him , to realize a dream which seemed to be impossible a few years earlier .
undoubtedly , when , al-ibrahimi , former counselor to the un 's secretary general , who embodies a considerable history of dealing with various diplomatic activities and efforts expended in a myriad crises in many third world countries , returns to proclaim the failure of his mission and pinpoint the causes and nature of mistakes he fell prey to , in a total lack of convulsion and conceit , in so doing , he will have divested himself of the stubborn diplomatic attire , which does not allow one to be willing to appear at fault , but compels one to refuse to admit it , so that one continues to tread the path of error , because one 's ego and pride do not allow one to accept this , despite the conviction that one will be subjected to repercussions and dangers .
.
in an interview , with an arab newspaper , al-ibrahimi confirmed the failure of his mission in iraq , which he qualified as " impossible " , in the wake of the different kinds of vetos to which he was submitted while undertaking his mission . al-ibrahimi , who still bears the title of " man of difficult missions " , did not deny his feeling of unease for accepting to collaborate with the occupation authorities in iraq in this critical situation , considering at that time that what brought him to accept this mission was the american confirmation that it is trying to end the occupation , at the soonest possible time . this was not true , and after a while it became clear that all the americans were interested in , was not to search for a solution to the current situation in iraq , but to search for a solution to the problem they created for themselves in iraq , especially before the american public , who realized that the pretexts of the white house administration to justify the war , were abstract and built upon falsified reports .
maybe what compelled al-ibrahimi to admit his failure was not just a single specific reason , but remains tied to a chain of causes , the most important that he realized that occupation , wherever it may be , attracts opposition and opposition attracts repression , torture and secret prisons , and that it is impossible in any case for the military option to be the required solution in iraq .
al-ibrahimi 's confessions demonstrated a de facto state existing in iraq for many months , not only in regards to material losses and signs of destruction and ruin , but more importantly in the volume of human losses , psychological injuries , loss and destitution , while there remains a persistent need for an influential national personality capable of gathering and unifying iraqi ranks , which is a very important issue that will assist in escaping the current situation , and overcoming the various challenges of the coming phase .
is it still possible , after such a long tribulation for iraqis , to have a review of the erroneous policies in iraq , to salvage what is still salvageable , and provide iraqis with an opportunity to restore their independence , away from any kind of guardianship and solutions imported via " pre - packaged " democracy ?
news analysis : after hamas victory and alliance with damascus , tehran and moscow , will washington retreat from political plans in arab world
by : kamal bin younes .
tunisia - al-sabah . pressures have escalated on the american administration , after the victory of hamas by majority in the palestinian parliamentary elections , that it might let go of its plans aiming at economic and political reform in the greater middle east , in other words the muslim arab world from morocco to indonesia , so these elections do n't benefit the " radical trend " of the enemies of washington and the west .
especially since all american polls
and european ones predict the increase of sentiments opposed to the united states ' policy and the atlantic capitals in the public opinion of the muslim & arab world , because of the afghanistan and iraq wars and the american administration as well as all western governments ' siding with sharon 's administration throughout its oppressive campaign against the palestinian people and leaders for the past 5 years ...
according to the " financial times " newspaper , american president george bush 's administration , is at the moment " reconsidering its announced plan on spreading democracy in the middle east , after the victory of islamic hamas movement in the latest palestinian parliamentary elections " .
the newspaper mentioned that the " new mayors " who are close to the american president , have started revising their plans for spreading democracy in the middle east after the overwhelming victory of the hamas movement " .
it added that ever since the results of those elections came out , " a great flow of reports and studies showered bush 's government , advising them to be careful and slow down in the matter of spreading democracy in the middle east " .
ceasing to pressure governments .
many recommendations were also issued by conservative research and intellectual centers which support the republican administration in the white house , inviting them to " not pressure arab governments " , and stop supporting " the trend of imposing a pattern for spreading democracy in eastern europe , on countries of the islamic region " .
supporters of anti - democratizing the islamic arab region , link the victory of hamas and electoral gains which the conservative party reaped in the iranian elections , with that of the nominees of the muslim brotherhood organization by winning 5 seats in parliament for the first time in egypt .
military and security alliance
according to the " financial times " and many european and american sources , " despite the criticisms which the government directed to the egyptian regime for breaking the law during the latest parliamentary elections " , the american budget for 2007 is expected to increase the military and security aid with which washington provides cairo , considering it " an important ally in the war against terror " ..
in other words , the priority of washington and its european allies will be security , not politics .
alliance of hamas with washington 's opponents
this debate which will continue in european and american media will increase in intensity due to many situations , including :
the support of many governments which washington and european capitals consider opponents of hamas ( and its upcoming government ) , especially syria , iran , sudan , the russia and venezuela , and the list may get bigger to include other countries like cuba , korea , china and many muslim and arab countries ...
the subjective alliance between tehran , moscow , beijing and many european and asian countries against the view promoting a siege in iran because of the iranian nuclear program .
and tehran 's external policy after the victory of ahmadi najad and the weakening of the moderate reform party led by mohammed khatami and his former education secretary muhajarani ...
the loss of most of washington 's liberal and secular allies in the iraqi elections ...
and the conflict 's focus on the iraqi elections , the political game and security battles between sunni , shiite and kurdish trends , parties and groups , which have many conflicts , the overwhelming majority of which are of a religious nature ...
... and there is no distinguishing between religion and politics .
continuity of security instabilities and a series of suicidal attacks against american and ally forces in iraq and afghanistan ( thousands of american casualties and injured in 2005 alone ) and against israeli targets in occupied palestine ...
despite plans supporting reform and democracy , which president bush 's administration adopted years back ...
which means that these plans , till now , did not help improve public opinion and that of radical parties in " the greater middle east " about washington and its policy in the region ...
decisions of georgia and istanbul summits
it might be too early to predict that washington will completely retreat from its great plan , which was adopted by the group of 8 in the georgia summit and atlantic alliance summit in istanbul , 2004 , which aims at repeating the east european scenario in the muslim arab world ...
but many indications reveal the hesitation of american and european decision makers in continuing to support the " democratic reform " plan ...
... if this democracy is going to create forces hostile to the strategic interest of washington and its allies in the region
and in the world ...
starting with israeli interests ..
and if this hesitation continues , the priority of washington and its allies will once again be military security , not politics ,
despite public declarations issued many times by president bush junior and both his former secretary of state colin powell and current secretary rice , which attributed the main reason of the uprising of anti - western anti - american terrorist groups to be their support , for the past 60 years , of the security option over freedom and democracy ...

chinese law defends women 's rights . fifth edition .
abortion remains a critical issue for legislators .
elective abortion of female fetuses and the destroying female newborns are forbidden in the amended draft paper to overcome the gender imbalance of childbirths in china .
according to the fifth national census of 2004 , the difference in proportion is 100 females to 117 males amongst children .
even so , some legal experts do not wish to take legal action against such abortions , believing that women have the freedom to choose in their pregnancy .
doctor
shia says : " it is urgent to resolve this contradiction but it is not possible to control elective abortion , without a set of restraints in all its forms , because there is no way to ascertain the reasons behind a woman 's decision to abort .
the amended draft paper also points out to interest in the public arena , besides academics .
yan chiaou ching , 50 years old , employee in nanjing , observed that society offered many opportunities to women in the previous decades . the social position of women must be considerably enhanced .
she says : " the main problem consists in that we women must enlarge our horizons and strive to learn earnestly , to acquire more knowledge and augment our awareness towards gender equality and self confidence .
and if you are not ready and able to compete , you have only yourself to blame .

twelve cartoons which insult the prophet mohammed were published by a danish newspaper last september and republished in other european countries , evoked tensions in the islamic world .
any imagery of the prophet , negative or positive , is considered blasphemy in the view of most muslims .
violent protests erupted in syria and lebanon , where angry demonstrators set fire to both the danish and norwegian embassies in their countries .

people 's assembly of egypt approves adjournment of local council elections
cairo , february 15 , xinhua : egyptian parliamentary sources have reported today , wednesday , that the people 's assembly of egypt last night approved a draft law introduced by egyptian president hosni mubarak to adjourn local council elections for a period of two years .
the same national democratic party affiliated source stated to the " xinhua " agency in cairo that the people 's assembly had unanimously adopted during its session last night , tuesday , a draft law decreeing the extension of the terms of existing local councils by two years . in practice , this means the adjournment of the elections which were supposed to take place over the next two months .
the source made clear that the assembly witnessed heated debates between delegates of the muslim brotherhood party , official opposition parties , and a number of independent delegates who objected to the draft law , on the one hand , and the ruling national democratic party delegates on the other .
it also pointed out that the lengthening of the term of local councils by two years on top of their current tenure , until the next council elections , would , according to the new vision for the local administration system , and what was included in the new law articles , fulfill the requirements of the constitutional amendments aimed for by president hosni mubarak .
it added that holding elections now would , according to the current laws of local administration , make the newly - elected councils incompatible with what is being introduced in the new local administration laws regarding plans and rulings that support local administration , and enhance its executive and supervisory powers .
the source confirmed that the two - year adjournment proposal is in agreement with a very practical consideration ; that an adjournment of only one year would make the elections of local people 's councils coincide with the new half - term elections of the consultative ( shura ) council , which start in april 2007 . practical considerations dictate that this matter must be avoided . in consideration of the above , the draft law , and the attached postscript , intend for the current local people 's councils to continue for two years longer than the current term .
two days ago , the egyptian consultative ( shura ) council approved the adjournment of local elections .
it has been mentioned that the term of the current elected local councils in egypt would come to an end next april on the 15th , and according to egyptian law , elections of local councils are supposed to take place within sixty days of the end of a term .
opposition parties and political powers in egypt have rejected the consultative ( shura ) council 's decision to agree to the election adjournment law , accusing the ruling democratic national party of attempting to prevent them from entering the elections , and of marginalizing their role in the local arena .

the statement added that " the completion of the expansion and annexing wall has created a racist system in the west bank , annexing east jerusalem and isolating al-aghwar ; the increase in settlement activity and the take - over of water resources means that the israeli government is implementing a long term transitional scheme , or a state of temporary borders in the hope of a long term truce " .
the statement also warned that " the implementation of these plans would result in a humanitarian , agricultural , educational and healthcare catastrophe for all residents of al-aghwar , as the israeli settlers , numbering eight thousand , have taken control of water resources and most agricultural lands in al-aghwar , as well as constructed industrial colonial residential zones , and those related to the presence of livestock .
