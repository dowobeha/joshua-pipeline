< headline > why do we moslems speak in high sounding terms when demanding implementation of human rights for moslem minorities in the west while we refuse to implement them for christians in the countries where we form the majority ?
< poster > by dr. yusra mustafa , a moslem writer , but who is against terrorism
if our islamic governments , which take the religion of islam as the source of their legislation , do not like human rights and especially the rights of minorities to perform their religious rituals , then this is something understandable . but human rights are viewed with suspicion by elites and some populist figures outside the sphere of government , this is something that requires consideration and explanation .
we have noticed during the last few years that one of the great challenges facing women 's and human rights groups is integrating human rights in a culture that still does not want to acknowledge the principles of human rights and their universality .
as we know , the main basis for rejecting human rights is represented in the cultural privacy discourse , which argues that our societies have different values from the values of human rights since human rights values are of a foreign source and character .
anyway , the dilemma of disseminating the culture of human rights exists not just because of restrictions imposed by the state . in addition to that , there is a general culture that is nourished by the cultural privacy discourse with the aim of removing legitimacy from the universal values of human rights .
in fact , this cultural rejection is a reality that cannot be ignored , and non - government political and ideological powers are contributing to stirring it up . better than ignoring it , we must look for its causes .
i believe that the principles of human rights do not find an echo in our societies , not because these principles are western , but perhaps because they are foreign to legal and political systems which deal with human rights selectively and with double standards .
it is not hidden from anyone who follows the news that human rights are not rejected in their totality , but only some of them are rejected . for example , collective rights are accepted . although political rights annoy the government , they nevertheless find listening ears with the opposition forces , including those which promote cultural privacy .
but personal rights are the real dilemma and are the ones which stir up the cultural privacy discourse , not only with governments but also with political and ideological forces which collaborate with the authority to create a public opinion antagonistic to the universality of human rights in the name of privacy .
when we talk about the right to development , we have a collective comfortable feeling and accuse the other foreign person of exploiting us . and when we talk about the right to form parties , the opposition responds , but the government gets angry .
but when it is a matter of freedom of thought and belief or personal rights for women , the cultural privacy discourse emerges to remove legitimacy from human rights because these are considered western concepts . consequently , the issue of cultural privacy is not used to oppose human rights in general , but in a partial , selective way , specifically when the issue is basically about personal rights and freedoms .
thus , if we want to look for the reason which makes the principles of human rights lack cultural legitimacy in our societies , we have to start from our cultural and political position toward personal rights .
that is , we have to hold the thread at the beginning by asking the preliminary question about the extent of the legitimacy of personal rights themselves before we talk about the legitimacy of human rights .
there is a valuable article by the german philosopher habermas entitled , " towards bestowing legitimacy by means of human rights , " in which he says : new laws emerge essentially from personal rights .
these rights let a legal person to behave according to his own priorities .
thus , in a very just way these rights release the person with a right from any other kind of instructions or ethical or moral commandments .
anyway , no one is compelled legally , within what is permitted legally , to reveal his work openly .
habermas refers to the incorporation of personal freedoms into the structure of the new law . thus , it became different from traditional legal systems . this confirms hobbes 's principle which says : everything is permitted unless it is explicitly forbidden . in this way , law is separated from ethics .
the separation of law from ethics in the new law is an important issue , not because we love law and hate ethics but because this is the modern historical logic of the principle of the rule of law .
this separation historically allowed basically legal individuals to be formed based on the concept of personal rights . this was in comparison with traditional systems which include basically moral individuals . these individuals are formed and controlled according to the dictates of ethical systems based on religion or on customs and traditions or even on modern political ideologies .
if the modern law is based on the concept of personal rights , then the moral discourse is based on a collective comprehensive concept of truth and duty .
in fact , when it is a matter of the individual in our societies , we find ourselves living in a three - dimensional manner : first , we are legal persons according to historical evolution which we do not ignore . there is a law that governs us even though that law derogates public and personal rights .
second , in terms of the civil law , religious , moral , and terrorist elements overlap : for example , personal status laws , freedom of thought and belief , or the practice of religious rights for minorities .
third , we are persons governed , in large areas of our lives , by purely moral rules which have more power than laws , especially when related to personal rights .
even that amount of freedom which is not restricted by law is restricted by morals , contrary to the law .
as an example , the collective religious discourse , or whatever is determined by customs and traditions , intervenes to impose on an individual lifestyles in the framework of a system of rules and moral , illegal restrictions by which the life of individuals as moral beings is regulated .
some may imagine that legal rules are in constant competition with moral rules . but this is not true to a large extent .
law and morals may meet in a positive way when both law and morals consider as criminal offenses , such as homicide and theft .
but they both meet in a negative way to restrict freedoms and personal rights .
in our societies particularly , law retreats , except in its suppressive forms , leaving its arena to moral rules , not because they compete with it but because these rules play a functional role that is in the interest of the authority , namely , the role of societal control , especially in the area of rights and personal freedoms .
within this disciplinary formula , an alliance takes place between three powers : the political power , the religious power , and the power of customs and traditions .
therefore , what cannot be controlled by law , can be controlled by morals ; the individual will be punished even if he does not violate the law .
it must be noted that this process of control depends on moral punishments which may develop into violence . in this case individuals will be categorized not according to their commitment or non - commitment to the law , but according to a moral division following the separation between what is pure and what is impure in the elementary meaning .
the religious discourse directed to women uses moral classification . it may say that the veil is chastity and purity . consequently , a woman who does not wear a veil will be punished culturally and socially because she is considered to have lost her legitimacy with regard to purity and chastity .
this kind of classification can also be found in political ideologies . thus , we hear those who say , " honorable citizens , " referring to the fact that anyone who does not follow this political approach is only a citizen , and if he opposes it , he may judge himself as a non - honorable citizen .
the language of chastity , purity , and honor implies a kind of illegal punishment to moral beings .
hereby the crisis of the legitimacy of human rights emerges . the language of human rights is basically legal and humane ; that is , it is designed to address legal beings that live within a political and legal system based on citizenship which acknowledges the personal rights of individuals and protects them .
but the problem , as mentioned above , is that the legal being does not have cultural legitimacy , and it is substituted by basically moral beings .
accordingly , the human rights discourse enters a sphere foreign to its legal language and vocabulary ; thus , it is treated in a selective manner whereby it accepts whatever is collective and rejects whatever is personal .
the legitimacy of human rights cannot be established unless there is collective acknowledgement that they are legitimate .
this acknowledgement will not take place if there are forces which are afraid of human rights and individuals who are not aware of the language of the law , which is the language of human rights . they are only aware of the language of morals , which is the language of political and religious authority and the authority of customs and traditions .
hereby the importance of defending the issue of citizenship emerges , not in its capacity as an issue of tolerance and coexistence , but basically in its capacity as a project for civil rights and reconsideration of the legal character based on personal rights and freedoms .

even cows ... make mistakes !
badriya al-abd al-rahman
i know that my topic is the hottest on the islamic front these days ...
it may seem repetitive to many of you to talk about the danish stupidity that mobilized the emotions of muslims all over the world ... and how it enabled us to read and calm the situation that heralded things whose consequences are not praiseworthy ...
what is the story ?
how can we clearly explain this exceptional behavior ?
can we for example , read it as a rude awakening of religious fanaticism , in a century marked by tolerance and anti - fanaticism ?
or is it a ruder awakening of non - religious fanaticism against religion , religions , and religious symbols ?
the most astonishing thing is that it happened in a peaceful , quiet country , notably remote from worldwide decision - making . ... or maybe its political stagnation and non involvement , ( not with prejudice ) and its geographical distance from areas full of cultural and intellectual clashes against muslims in particular ... and against other cultures in general were reasons that caused the controversy ...
that a spontaneous action , even if exceptional , by some magazine resulted in provoking resentment among followers of the islamic religion , which is embraced by millions throughout the world ...
what is worse is that this provocation did not happen by way of good will or to push for discussion with the other party ... rather it was to create a badge of islamic identity on which to hang accusation and predetermined clichés about our religion ...
the whole scene was a considerable danish stupidity . i do n't think that it will easily be conveyed through history ... and i do n't believe the country of cows and butter , with its exaggerated image of goodness and innocence needed to flex its muscles when it decided to do so by provoking islamists and muslims of all walks of life ...
why just islam ... ?
using the most important symbol of this religion , his noble prophet ( peace and blessings be upon him ) ... and an impudent , perfectly stereotypical image of islam were marketed , by describing it as a religion of bombs and death ... unconditionally ... highly unconditional ... because the function of a newspaper cartoon is to depict a real image ... that is true and undisputed , except by fools ... !
quite simply , we were sold short , and the long history of a great religion was summed up in a cartoon which insults just us , none of all the religions and intellectual trends in the world , in the name of many of which atrocities and crimes were committed against the whole world ... singling out islam on the death list ...
just like that sanctity is violated and fanaticism crosses the red line , going hundreds of meters beyond the line , without the least shame or rationale ... as if religions had become stale goods and products with no regard for what they symbolize , what they accomplish , and how they affect the souls of their adherents ...
in short ... it is impoliteness and impudence according to the standard of intellectual protocol ... according to the standard of political protocol ... according to all protocols . nothing is taken into consideration by this stupidity except that it is impolite . afterwards , denmark does not expect against itself any stupider behavior because of it ... because it was , in short , ( more disrespectful and viler ) .
misery and wretchedness from this image , not only because it is ugly and false ... but also because it awakens issues firmly set in the western mentality for centuries against the muslim ... the muslim associated with death , the sword , horses , and beheading for the sake of god ... and nothing more ..
sediments that found someone to roil them to disturb the relative harmony muslims are enjoying in the west , particularly in denmark , because of fanatics of any intellectual background who do n't realize the danger of their actions ...
what did denmark actually get itself into , by god ?
how does it expect to gain our respect after all that happened ?
how can it secure its citizens in the islamic countries and everywhere else after the wave of anger that swept the muslims ?
just questions , i do n't know if it dawned on the danish mentality , public opinion , and decision makers ... or is this mentality still busy milking its cows and spreading its butter , oblivious of the serious predicament which some magazine editors dragged it into , a magazine that in the mind of every muslim represents every danish person ... !
let 's boycott ... in order to be ... !
the unified messages through cell phones and emails to boycott danish products and smear its reputation , is a good healthy phenomenon that i support without any reservations ...
since the days of boycotting american and israeli products , the arab islamic mentality has been vigilant , producing its numerous and sometimes distressing " nos , " but in a beautiful , impressive way ... even if we disagree with it ...
the world must comprehend that a muslim is no longer a member of a group of nations , the majority of which are third world countries , that decided for him ( without consulting him ) ... rather he became a cultured person , aware of his cultural background , which is the islamic religion , regardless of his sect or the difference in commitment to the religious regulations ...
what is important is that he knows now how to say " no " ... in a loud but civilized voice , and in a way that expresses his weariness of the arrogance of westerners against the arabs who need them , seek refuge in them , and line up in order to obtain visas to enter and work there ...
the western arrogance which had gone on for too long , continued and recently overflowed to violate that which is sacred ... the sacred which in all cultures is considered an important red line and entitles everyone to protest its violation in a belittling and mocking manner ...
when i say this i know that all the boycotting , mine and yours , will not hurt or lessen the value of danish butter or its worldwide reputation ... or its stupid cows . ... but we will do it for ourselves ... so that we do n't lose the one and only simple " no " that we now have , and which is filling our mouths ...
let us say that we exist and live on this planet with all our problems and crises ... that we are able to coexist , that we deserve respect ... that we have the right to express ourselves , to reject ... and if need be , even hate ...
in order to avoid creating discord and pumping additional hatred into the sea of resentment engulfing this miserable planet ... , i hope that denmark would initiate a sincere apology to the muslims and muffle the crisis ...
it should n't expect that one apology would clear the united islamic heart on the spot ... because the shock was overwhelming , and erasing it will not be easy ...
because if that apology does n't happen , we will keep singing this tune for the rest of our lives ... nursing the pain of hatred .... we will teach our children , and our children will teach their children that denmark and satan are brothers and require the same treatment ...
if that apology does n't happen , resentment will continue to rage ... maybe denmark will be stunned by what initially provoked the emotions of muslims .... maybe it will find a good application of the heartless terrorist model , wearing the turban ( equipped with a bomb ) on its land among its beautiful citadels and dull cows ...
maybe denmark will lose all its beauty and innocence ( because of its insolence ) ...
maybe this time , its cows chattered much more stupidly than necessary ...
maybe it does n't take more than a few days for us to witness something we never hoped would happen in denmark ...
maybe everything will happen ( here or there ) ...
oh how much i hate " maybe " in these contexts ! god protect us from the evil of the word " maybe " ... !!!

negative and positive self programming
most people are programmed at a young age to behave , talk or believe in a certain negative way , and it grows with them until they become prisoners of what is called " negative programming " which limits their access to many things in life .
we find that a large number of them say , " i have a weak personality , " " i ca n't quit smoking , " " i am weak in spelling , " " i. .. "
we find that they acquire this negativity from either family or school or friends , or all of them .
but can this negativity be transformed into positive programming ? the answer is a definite yes . but why do we need to do that ?
in order to be happy , successful and lead a good life , we need to positively program ourselves . we especially as muslims have a mission and a goal that we have to accomplish in order to worship god almighty and serve as his vicegerents on earth .
before we begin transforming the negative programming , we have to agree on the following :
it is important that you yourself make the decision that you want to change . your decision will serve as your guide leading you to change from negativity to positive programming .
repeating words and behaviors that you will identify and make them part of your life .
now the first step to positive programming is :
speaking to yourself
have you ever watched someone talking loudly to himself while walking , moving his arms , mumbling , and maybe even cursing ? excuse me , but we do n't want to act like him .
or have you ever had a heated argument with someone , and once he left you replayed the argument in your mind and you started thinking of the argument once again , changing words around and telling yourself , " why did n't i say this or that ? "
did it ever happen that while attending a lecture or listening to a speech you said to yourself , " i could n't give a speech like that , " or " how could i face all those people ? " or " it would be impossible for me to give a speech or give a lecture in front of people . "
all of this inner conversation leads to negative human programming , which ultimately could lead to disastrous effects .
fortunately you , i , and anyone can deal with self talk , and we are able to transform any negative programming into a new one that empowers us .
a psychology engineering specialist says : " we have the ability to change our past and our future at any moment through reprogramming our present . "
therefore as of this moment we have to watch and pay attention to these inner voices that speak to you .
it was said :
pay attention to your thoughts because they will become deeds .
pay attention to your actions because they will become habits .
pay attention to your habits because they will become your character .
pay attention to your character because it will determine your future .
i would like to explain some scientific facts about the human mind . we will focus particularly on the subconscious .
the subconscious does not reason the same way the conscious mind does . it simply stores information and afterwards repeats it every time it is retrieved from storage .
if a message is programmed over a long period of time and constantly repeated , like for example , if every time you face a situation you say , " i am a shy person , " " i am a shy person , " " i am bad tempered , " or " i ca n't play sports , " " i ca n't quit smoking , " and so on , these kinds of messages will be deeply embedded in the subconscious and can not be changed . but they can be replaced through healthy positive programming .
another fact is that the subconscious mind has strange behavior which we must become aware of . for example , if i tell you : " do n't think of a black horse " can you actually do that and prevent your mind from thinking ? of course not . you probably already thought of a black horse .
why ?
your mind canceled the word " no " and stored the rest of the sentence : " think of a black horse . "
so can we take advantage of such strange behavior of the mind ?
let us now present the essence of the matter by quoting what dr. ibrahim al-fiqi wrote in his book " the power of self control : principles and a practical program for positive self programming . "
he says :
the five rules for programming your subconscious mind are :
1- your message should be clear and specific .
2- your message should be positive . for example , " i am strong , " " i am well . " i can quit . "
3- your message should address the present . for example , do n't say , " i will be strong . " rather say , " i am strong . "
4- your message must be accompanied by a strong awareness of its contents in order for the subconscious to accept it and program it .
5- you should repeat the message several times to be completely programmed .
now here is a plan to follow for a positive conversation with yourself .
write down at least five negative internal messages that had an impact on you , such as the following :
i am a shy person , i ca n't quit smoking , i have a bad memory , i ca n't speak in front of an audience , i am bad tempered , now , tear the paper that you wrote these negative messages on and throw it away .
write down five positive messages that empower you and always start with " i. " for example :
" i can quit smoking , " " i like talking to people . " " i have a good memory . "
" i am a special person , " " i am active and energetic . "
write down your positive message in a small notebook and always keep it with you .
now take a deep breath and read the messages one after the other until you totally comprehend them .
once again start with the first message . take a deep breath and get rid of any tension in your body . read the first message ten times with strong feeling . close your eyes and imagine the new you . open your eyes .
starting today pay attention to what you say to yourself , what you say to others , and what others say to you . if you notice any negative message , cancel it by saying , " cancel " and replace it with another positive message .
believe that you have the power , that you can be , that you have control , and that you can do whatever you want to do by simply defining precisely what you want and moving in that direction with all your strength . jim rohn , author of " eternal happiness , " said , " repetition is the mother of skills . "
that is why you have to believe in what you say , and always repeat to yourself the positive messages . you are your own master and the captain of your ship . you control your life and you can transform your life into a positive experience of happiness , health , and success without limits .
always remember :
live each moment as though it were the last moment of your life .
live by faith . live by hope
live by love . live by struggle .
value life .
( quoted from " the power of self control " by dr. ibrahim al-fiqi . )
finally , i pray for guidance , forgiveness , and mercy .
amen .
your brother in god .

dandruff : causes and cure
i think it is a very widespread problem . nearly everyone has suffered from it at one time or another in their life .
they used to believe that dandruff is caused by the rapid growth of the scalp cells , but this belief was proven wrong .
recently they discovered that dandruff is caused by a kind of yeast known as pityrosporum ovale ,
the problem begins when the blood circulation in the scalp weakens ,
stress
the use of hot water to wash hair ,
also the nature of oily hair plays an important role .
sometimes dandruff does n't constitute a significant problem . but when it falls on clothes , causes itching , or when it causes hair to smell bad the problem starts to appear .
elegance and prestige evaporate . dandruff then becomes an issue that needs an answer .
the question is : how do we cure it ?
there are general tips that we should consider :
1. not to use other people 's tools for grooming hair .
2. make sure to keep our personal tools clean . in other words , wash the brush and comb at least once a week .
3. wash hair with certain kinds of treatment shampoos that are available in stores .
my advice is to use nazirol shampoo . i am not trying to advertise the product or anything , but this shampoo contains ketoconazole , which is an effective ingredient for getting rid of the yeasts that cause dandruff .
4. after using the shampoo , rinse your hair with vinegar diluted with water while massaging the scalp .
meanwhile , there are some effective prescriptions :
*wash your hair .
rub your hair with apple vinegar
leave it on for 15 minutes .
rinse it .
*wash your hair .
mix half a cup of apple vinegar with half a cup of a lemon juice .
use the mixture to massage your scalp .
leave the mixture on your hair for half an hour .
rub your hair with olive oil . leave it on for another 15 minutes and then shampoo your hair .
repeat the process once a week until the dandruff disappears . you might only need to use it once .
*olive oil , almond oil , and cactus oil help to restore balance to the scalp and provide nutrients .
greetings and stay well .

grief at the red sea
when my father saw the ferry capsizing and about to sink he put the life jacket on me .
after that i watched my father and then my mother drown .
i was left alone for 30 hours struggling against the waves . one of the survivors was helping me until the rescue team arrived and pulled me out of the water .
everything was lost .
for three difficult years i lived in saudi arabia , away from my homeland .
i came back with my life " savings " in order to get married and settle down .
but suddenly everything was lost .. everything .
there was a fire in the lower decks of the ferry .
but the crew prevented some of the passengers who saw the fire from wearing the life jackets , claiming that it would only cause unnecessary panic among the rest of the passengers .
this was the outcome , as you see .
the ferry sank , and more than a thousand passengers drowned .
when we saw smoke coming out of the engine room on the lower deck , the ferry crew told us , " do n't worry , we will put it out . "
when things dramatically worsened , we could not find the life boats . some of the ferry workers had taken them and left us on the ship to face death alone .
for 30 hours i was in the water struggling against death .
30 hours without food or water .
my skin was about to melt .
is there no respect for us as human beings ?
if the ferry passengers were israelis , would they have been treated with this same neglect or this same lateness ?
god blessed me with three children -- two girls and a boy . we all lived together in saudi arabia ,
we decided to come back and settle in egypt .
i shipped my house furniture , my children 's books and all of our belongings .
a little while after we took off at sea we became terrified when we saw the smoke coming out of the ferry .
then it capsized and sank .
i saw my three children and my wife screaming and swallowing water . i was screaming trying to rescue them but fate was stronger .
i watched all of them drown .
their books and some of their toys were floating on the surface .
god gives and god takes .
there is no power and no strength except in god .
when the fire grew we heard sounds of explosions coming from the ferry 's kitchen .
we thought it was the gas tanks exploding .
we yelled at the captain to go back to the port of dubah which is closer than safaga , but he refused .
we were terrified . the captain ordered us to knock on doors to get the passengers out of their cabins and gather them on the right side to balance the ferry , but within five minutes everybody drowned .
there was screaming and crying everywhere .
men were appealing to god , " god save us ! god have mercy on us ! "
"
others were reciting the muslim creed .
*****
god have mercy on the victims of the accident , and grant their families patience and consolation !

because it is a sacred month , and because it is valued by god almighty as a great month , the prophet ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) connected it to god almighty , and said that it was the month of god .
it is the month of muharram .
voluntary fasting during this month is one of the best ways to please god .
it is better than any other voluntary fast through the whole year .
so make sure to fast as much as possible during this month .
do n't forget to include me in your prayers .
may god bless our prophet muhammad , his family , and his companions .

< headline > men 's chastity
< poster > abu suleiman
why does men 's chastity have no value and get no respect ?
why has the chaste man , who controls his desires , become a topic of astonishment and suspicion ?
why is the man who does n't practice illegal premarital sex , viewed by some as an idiot ?
why has the man who does n't cheat on his wife become a coward , scared that his wife might find out , or find his manhood questioned ?
our society is highly concerned with women 's virginity .
but why does n't anyone address men 's virginity ?
in an era of openness and modernization , all means that facilitate committing what is forbidden are available .
temptations surround us and are easily
obtained . there is nothing easier than the way of error which leads to depravity .
but we cannot use this as an excuse to commit sins ,
if both men and women are affected by these temptations , then they are equal in accountability and punishment ,
according to the divine rule in god 's word : " tell the believing men to lower their gaze , and guard their chastity . and tell the believing women to lower their gaze and guard their chastity . "
since the best , right way is to measure our behavior in accordance with the divine legislation and rule , we find that the revelation is absolutely clear in extending the concept to include men and women .
god says : " for men and women who guard their chastity , and for men and women who engage much in allah 's praise , for them has allah prepared forgiveness and great reward . " ( the confederates : 35 )
so a man 's chastity is no less important than a woman 's , and it does not belittle his manhood . therefore , just as chastity is expected from a woman , it is also expected from a man .
we have to extend the concept of virginity to include both men and women in order for the equation to be right .
but in our eastern societies concepts are imbalanced .
chastity is only required from a woman . it is her capital and the basis for her family 's honor .
as for a man 's chastity , feel free to talk about it .
nothing shames him , following the principle that any sin is permissible as long as it is discreet .
this is an invitation to everyone to pursue chastity and abstain from committing what is forbidden .
let us get rid of the common notion that a man 's chastity is something he should be ashamed of , and he should avoid it in order not be labeled as an idiot uncultured , and inexperienced .
man 's chastity represents his modesty . it is a virtue for the man who has it . it strengthens his faith , and helps him walk the straight and narrow and abstain from committing sins , avoid the wrath of god , and stay healthy and disease - free .
chastity begins in the heart , and extends to the whole body . for a man it is a clear indication of his strong character , his superiority , his ability to abstain from committing vice , his ability to control his desires , and his ability to control himself from being lured into temptations .
a chaste person is an adult who has self control over all his desires and instincts , and who abides by god 's rules in satisfying them .
he is a patient person who is eager to avoid committing sins and controls his desires .
his is a rare character achievable only by those who have strong faith .
the revelation includes all single men .
" those who are not able to get married , let them abstain . "
tha'lab interpreted it as follows :
let him have self control just like for fasting since it is honorable .
chastity is expected from married and unmarried men alike .
how many men cheat on their wives and brag about their adventures to others so that they do n't appear in front of others to have less status , or be less manly , and so they do not become the object of derision .
dear brother , i ask you not to be weak . maintain your purity and chastity .
do n't give in to temptations .
try to strengthen your faith in god .
if you weaken remember that god is watching you and you will be questioned . we will all be questioned about our deeds . your manhood will not intercede for you so that god can forgive you . the divine words are clear .
chastity is not just a requirement for women . it is the duty of every person .
do n't make society a measure of your actions .
if you were not held accountable during your lifetime you wo n't escape punishment on judgment day .
remember that death does not announce itself .
when it comes for you , it will not wait till you repent .
when their time come they can not delay it or advance it by an hour .
if you accept evil deeds , do n't expect and do n't request favorable reward .
remember that reward is a measure of your deeds .
if you have been plagued with evil do n't expect that god will grant you a good wife .
in the sura " light " god almighty says " impure women are for impure men , and impure men are for impure women ; and women of purity are for men of purity , and men of purity are for women of purity : these are not affected by what people say : for them there is forgiveness and an honorable provision . "
"
god i ask you to grant me chastity and wealth .
"
we ask god to protect muslim youth from all harm and evil .
god is the best protector and he is the most merciful .

they tied her up .
and took away her senses .
by the movement and elevation , she felt like she had been put on a howdah .
she heard the voice of her love among them .
why is n't he reprimanding them ?
why is n't he stopping them from taking her ?
the sound of rhythmic steps on rough dirt .
cold dawn breeze touch her white clothes .
although she is unable to see , she imagined a foggy atmosphere surrounding her .
she pictured the ground that she is in now as empty and desolate .
..
finally , all at once the steps stopped , and she felt like she had been placed on the ground .
nearby she heard the sound of stones being picked up and laid down .
she was carried again . it was quiet all around . she felt the darkness eating away at her bones .
from above she could hear sobbing . it was her son . yes , it was him .
maybe he is coming to rescue her ?
but what is this she 's hearing ?
he is calling her in a low voice : " mother . "
through the tears her husband is talking to him , saying : " pull yourself together . "
patience is at the first stroke of a calamity .
pray for her , son .
let 's go ..
he felt a lump in his throat .
he took a final look at the shrouded body . he lost control and painfully said : " there is no deity except god . "
there is no deity except god ...
surely we belong to allah and to him we return ...
this was the last thing she heard him say ...
then there was the noise of a marble stone falling from above to cover the only opening that was the source of light , sound , and life .
the sound of steps leaving ...
where ?
where are you leaving me ?
how could you abandon me alone in this darkness ?
she looked around her and was able to see .
see ?
what could she see in this black cellar ?
the darkness is nothing like the darkness of the night she was used to which came with the moonlight , and the light of stars that reflected on things and people . here , she could barely see her hands . in fact , she feels like her eyes are completely closed .
she remembered her loved ones .
she heard the steps grow distant and disappear . she trembled .
she got up wanting to follow them .
how could they leave her knowing that she was scared of the darkness and of being alone ?
but a heavy hand violently sat her down .
terrified , she looked behind her and she saw something she had never seen before .
she saw terror materialize as a creature .
but how could she see it in this intense darkness ?
she asked in a trembling voice , " who are you ? "
she heard a voice ring out on her right : " we came to ask you . "
she turned around ..
there was another creature like the first one ..
helplessly she kept silent ...
she wished the earth would swallow her so she would n't see these people .
but then she remembered that the earth had already swallowed her ..
she wanted to die to get away from this inescapable reality .
she was confused ... her wishes were invalid . she was already dead ..
who is your god ?
hey . who is your god ?
my god ?
all my life i worshipped only allah .
what is your religion ?
my religion is islam .
who is your prophet ?
my prophet ?
she pressed her memory .
how could she forget his name ?
was n't she frequently saying it ?
when she recited the muslim profession of faith five times a day did n't she ask god to bless him ?
the voice repeated angrily : " who is your prophet ? "
one moment , please ...
i ca n't remember ..
the creature raised a thick stick and swiftly struck her on the head .
she screamed .
her organs convulsed ...
suddenly his name lit up in her mind :
she screamed at the top of her lungs : " my prophet is muhammad . "
muhammad .
then she forcefully closed her eyes but nothing happened ..
deadly silence ..
astonished , she opened her eyes .
the creature , whose name was nakir , told her : you were saved by an invocation you frequently repeated : " oh god , changer of hearts , fasten my heart on your religion . "
she shivered ..
... she wanted to smile happily but she could n't ...
this is not the time for smiling .
dear god , when will these horrible moments be over ?
after a while munkar told her : you used to delay the dawn prayers .
her eyes were wide open ...
she knew that she had no way out this time ...
because he did not skirt the truth ...
he pushed her in front of him ...
she wanted to cry but she could n't find the tears ...
she walked in front of munkar and nakir through a long cellar until she arrived a place that looked like a prison .
...
she felt nausea ...
she wished she would pass out ... but it did n't happen ...
she continued seeing the terrible place ...
in every corner there was screaming and blood ...
lamenting and wailing ...
and bones were breaking ...
and bodies were burning ...
stern merciless faces that would not respond to all these pleadings ..
the two angels pushed her from behind . she walked feeling her legs weakening ...
she found herself getting closer to a man lying on his back ..
right at the top of his head one of the stern , cold faces was standing ...
carrying a heavy boulder ...
right before her eyes the angel dropped the boulder on the man 's head ... it broke and rolled down away from his body ...
she screamed .
.. she cried ..
she was completely shocked that she could n't utter a word ..
soon the head was back on the body ..
the angel dropped the boulder on it again ...
here .. she was told : c'mon .. lie down beside this man . what ?
c'mon ..
she was pushed violently ..
she began resisting ..
and resisting ..
and resisting ..
to no avail .
a dark fate lies ahead ..
truly dark ..
she lay down terrified , sick to her stomach ..
she appealed to god .
she saw all the doors of invocation closed ..
the time to appeal had long gone .
... she wished she had prayed to god during the good times ..
she wished she had prayed to god during her life ..
she wished she could go back and perform two sets of prayers .
.. just two sets to put a good word for her ..
she looked upwards . an angel was standing above her .
.. raising a huge boulder .
telling her : this would be your torture until the day of resurrection because you used to sleep ignoring the mandatory prayers ...
when she was overcome by despair she saw the most handsome young man walking towards her ..
she was gripped by feelings of hope ...
his face was joyous and his smile lit up everything around him ..
the young man arrived and he spread his arms , blocking the angel ...
he said to him : what brought you ?
i was sent to protect her and to stop you .
did god almighty order this ?
yes ..
she could n't believe her eyes ...
the angel left , disappeared , and the handsome young man stayed ..
is she dreaming ?
the young man extended his hand to her .
she got up ..
gratefully she asked him : who are you ?
i am your good son 's prayers for you and his charity on your behalf ..
ever since you died , he has been constantly praying for you until god materialized his prayers in the most beautiful image and gave it permission to respond and come here .
once again , she felt the presence of munkar and nakir .
she turned to them .
they were saying : look . this was your place in hell . god has replaced it with a place in heaven .
( ( and a good son praying for him . ) )

< headline > explanation of how to transfer a cassette tape to a cd
< poster > mr. abuein
during the cassette tape era , it was almost impossible to find a home that did not have one .
because the cassette tapes were easy to use and inexpensive , they showed up at home , in the car , at the office , and everywhere else .
some of these cassettes were original , professionally recorded and more expensive . others were recorded at home and may have sentimental value representing a memorable event , or they might be a copy of a song or something else .
now we have entered the digital era . but that does not mean that we cancel our memories .
we can transfer these audio recordings -- whether they are on cassette tape , quarter inch tape , or lps -- to a digital mp3 device on digital cds . this would enable you to listen to them on the computer and digital cd players and send them anywhere by electronic mail .
preparing the devices and equipment
in order for you to be able to convert recordings on tapes to a digital form on the cd , you must first install the necessary equipment and programs on the computer so it will be able to perform this job . you must also have a computer that is relatively new , and that has a sound card .
in order to begin , you have to connect your cassette player to the computer . that is usually done by using the common connector as shown in the picture here . this connector is available in any store that sells electrical accessories , and usually it 's inexpensive .
connect one end of the connector to the line - out port , and connect the other end to the line - in port of the computer 's sound card .
the other thing is that you need a program able to record the sound that is coming through the line - in port of the sound card .
musicmatch jukebox is one of the best and easiest to use programs . this program has many useful features . most important is that you can get it for free on the internet .
download and install this program on your computer .
you can visit the website for this program to download it to your system . the website address is http://www.musicmatch.com/
or through this link . it is approximately nine megabytes . click here to download the program .
in order to be able to use the recording anywhere , and also to free the large amount of space used by the audio recordings on your hard drive , you should have cd recording equipment .
cd burners are also able to read cds .
this equipment uses two kinds of cds which are able to record audio and computer program data .
the first are cds that can record once only , while the others can record several times .
the second are better , but they are several times more expensive than the first type .
to begin :
step one :
after you have installed the musicmatch software , and you have connected the stereo to the sound card by using the connectors mentioned above , you can now start recording by taking the following steps :
start the musicmatch program .
from the upper menu choose in succession : " options , " then " recorder , " then " source , " and then " line - in , " as shown in the following picture :
now a new window will appear under the program 's first window . if it does not appear click on the rec button .
in this window you will see the two words " artist " and " album . " click on them , then change the name to the name of the new recording that you are about to make .
now press the record button " rec " in this window , and then start playing the cassette tape in the stereo .
when the recording is completed press the stop button , " stop . "
the recording must be completed and placed in the music library of the program .
you can repeat these steps for another recording .
recordings are automatically stored at a speed of 128 kbps which is more than enough for most high quality cassette recordings .
when the first recording is completed you must listen to it , to check the sound quality .
if the recording is muddled or too soft , you can reset the volume level from the stereo to the computer or by using the windows program itself .
at the bottom of the screen on the task bar you will find a volume icon that looks like a horn . double click on it , and then adjust the volume by using " play control " or " volume control . "
select " options , " then " properties , " then " recording , " and finally " ok . " a record control window will appear . select the desired volume .
of course you must make sure not to hit the " mute " button , otherwise you will get nothing .
you can use the special recording features in this program to adjust the various elements to enhance the sound . to do this , choose " options , " then " settings , " then " recorder , " then " advanced . "
from this box choose the sound effect you want , such as fades and other effects , in order to produce mp3 recordings similar to professional recordings .
with more expertise in this program and continued recording you will become more knowledgeable . converting your old recordings from analog to digital will become easier and faster .
after you have prepared 74 minutes at most of mp3 recordings , you can begin to make a digital audio compact disk .
step two :
after you pick and collect enough mp3 recordings you can make your own play list for recording on a cd arranged as you like .
you will find the play list on the right hand side of the musicmatch jukebox program window .
in order to copy a song or a musical piece to this list , you can use the mouse to drag any file from the music library to this window .
generally the recording cd can record 74 minutes of music . currently musicmatch does not work with the new 80 minute cds .
as soon as you finish preparing the musical pieces that you wish to record on the cd click on the " cd " button . a window or a new dialogue box will appear with a number of options for recording a cd .
make sure you select " audio " ( default ) as the type of disk that you want to create . if you select the other choice you can store more than 600 megabytes on the empty disk . but this type does not work with ordinary music cd players .
the status bar at the bottom of the window informs us how much empty space is still available on the cd .
you can add or delete from the play list that you intend to put on the cd , in order to produce a more accurate cd , by using " test then write cd . "
you may also want to leave one second or more of silence between two pieces of music .
when you are ready to copy , put the empty cd in the cd recorder and then click the " create cd " button .

< headline > the newcomer steals the spotlight from google
< poster > mr. abuein
1000 new members daily
the new website myspace steals the spotlight from google
www.myspace.com
a promising new star has recently begun to shine in the world of the internet , especially after it succeeded in creating a name that has become widely known in technical circles .
in just two years this newcomer has attracted a large number of visitors and users , exceeding all expectations . the number of users and visitors is two and half times greater than that of the internet giant google .
myspace has proved itself as one of the most important communities on the internet .
the secret behind the success of this site lies in its learning from the mistakes of its predecessors , transforming them into strong points , which has made it very appealing to young people , particularly among students and musicians , after it allowed them to interact with their friends and provided them with most of the services offered by other websites , in one place .
some may wonder about the secret behind the success of the site despite the fact that it is not the only website of its kind . but quite simply , why would its users need to go to another website when all their friends are on myspace , especially when users are encouraging and urging their friends to join the site ?
it also surpassed its competitors in being more capable of personalization , allowing the user the opportunity to add a personal touch to his page by means of background colors , layout , images , video clips , and various other features . this distinction allowed it to beat its stubborn competitor friendster when the total number of registered users exceeded 54 million ( with an average of 180,000 new members each day ) compared with more than 24 million users on friendster .
the new site introduces a new way to converse with your acquaintances and friends . the main page eliminates the need to download email or an instant messaging program . this is the page through which a user can hold discussions and exchange private messages . it also enables them to monitor their professors and their lectures .
in the midst of all this success looms the danger of the internet for adolescents , casting its shadow over the website 's success , particularly since the number of the site 's members who are minors amounted to a quarter of its total users .
a large number of students from all over the united states have been arrested after they threatened their colleagues on the website . furthermore , police in one state discovered illegal relationships between minors who met men on the website who claimed they were younger than they really were . this has forced parents and guardians to ban their children from using the website for fear of such dangers .
but this has not prevented the owners of the website from going forward in developing it and providing it with international services to expand the spectrum of its users to include users from all over the world , standing by the slogan " we will do anything to keep our users . "

< headline > this is love
< poster > yamuslim - owner < msm77777 @ ... >
this is love
ra'isiya : year : wednesday , 9 muharram 1427 a.h. - february 8 , 2006 . islam 's diary
in order for moslems to know the position of their prophet ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) and in order for moslems to know how to show real love to this great prophet , there are the following attitudes :
abu bakr ( may god be pleased with him )
here are the feelings which the heart of our master abu bakr formulates in words which are read .
our master abu bakr says , " we were migrating and i was very thirsty . i brought some diluted yogurt and gave it to the prophet ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) and said to him , ' drink , oh messenger of god . ' "
abu bakr says , " the prophet ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) drank until my thirst was quenched . "
your eyes are not lying !!
the phrase is correct and was said on purpose . that is what abu bakr the righteous said ..
have you tasted the beauty of this love ?
it is a special kind of love !
how do we measure in comparison to this love ?
consider this and do not be surprised .
it is love ,
love for the prophet more than love for self ..
the day mecca was conquered , abu qahafa , the father of our master abu bakr , converted to islam . he became a moslem at a very old age and had become blind . our master abu bakr took him to the prophet ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) to declare his conversion to islam and to pledge allegiance to the prophet ( god 's bless him and grant him salvation ) .
the prophet ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) said , " oh abu bakr , why did you not leave the old man in his house ? we could have gone to him . "
abu bakr said , " you are more worthy for him to be brought to you , oh messenger of god . " ..
abu qahafa became a moslem .. our master abu bakr the righteous cried .
he was told , " this is a day of joy . your father became a moslem and was saved from hell . so , what makes you cry ? "
can you imagine what abu bakr said ?
he said , " because i would have preferred to see abu talib pledging allegiance to the prophet , and not my father . this would have made the prophet happier , praise the lord . " he was happier when the prophet 's happiness was greater than his father 's .
how do we measure in comparison to this ?
umar ( may god be pleased with him ) says , " i was walking with the prophet ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) and some of his companions . the prophet took my hand and walked .
umar says , " i found myself saying , ' i really love you , oh messenger of god . ' "
the prophet ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) said to him , " more than your son , umar ? "
i said , " yes . "
he said , " more than your household , umar ? "
i said , " yes . "
he said , " more than your property , umar ? "
i said , " yes . "
he said , " more than yourself , umar ? "
i said , " no. " look at how honest he is with himself and with the prophet ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) .
the prophet ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) said , " no , umar . your faith will not be complete until you love me more than yourself . "
umar says , " i went out and thought . then i returned shouting , ' oh messenger of god , i really love you more than myself . "
the prophet ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) said , ' now , umar , now . "
abdallah the son of umar said , " father , what have you done to return with this idea ? "
umar said , " my son , i went out and asked myself who i will need more on the day of judgment : myself or the messenger of god ? "
i found out that i need him more than i need myself .
i remembered how i went astray and how god saved me through him .
abdallah the son of umar said to him , " my father , if you forget everything about the messenger of god , what is the one thing you will never forget ? "
umar said , " if i forget everything , i will never forget the day i went to him and said , ' oh messenger of god , allow me to go on the minor pilgrimage to mecca . "
he said to me , " do n't forget us in your righteous prayers , my brother . "
he said something to me that made me happy and meant the world to me .
anyone who only reads these words will not feel them .
they are really feelings which need a heart that loves the prophet ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) to receive them as they are : fresh and soft .
thawban ( may god be pleased with him )
the prophet ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) was away from our master thawban , his servant the whole day . when he came back , thawban said to him , " you made me miss you and feel lonely , oh messenger of god , " and he cried .
the prophet ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) said , " is this what makes you cry ? "
thawban said , " no , oh messenger of god . but i remembered your place in paradise and my place and i remembered how lonely i would be . "
the words of god almighty were revealed : " whoever obeys god , and the messenger -- they are with those whom god has blessed , prophets , just men , martyrs , the righteous ; good companions they are ! " [ 69 ] ( sura " women " ) .
sawad ) may god be pleased with him (
sawad ibn azziya was standing in the midst of the army during the uhud raid . the prophet ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) said to the army , " straighten up . stand upright . "
the prophet looked and saw that sawad did not do as he was told .
the prophet ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) said , " straighten up sawad . "
sawad said , " yes , messenger of god . " he stood , but he did not do as he was told .
we heard the moaning of the tree trunk when the prophet ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) departed .
the prophet ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) came with his tooth cleaning stick and pricked sawad in his abdomen .
sawad said , " you hurt me , oh messenger of god . god has sent you in truth , so lead me . "
when they built the pulpit for him , he left the tree trunk and went to the pulpit .
we saw the prophet ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) come down from the pulpit , go back to the tree trunk , and then wipe it .
he said , " straighten up , sawad . "
the prophet ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) used to preach in his mosque before the pulpit was built next to the tree trunk so that the companions of the prophet would see him . the prophet ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) would stand and hold the tree trunk .
what do you think of such love ?
lastly , do not be less than the tree trunk .
he said , " oh messenger of god , i think that today is a day of martyrdom . i wanted my last covenant with you to be touching my skin with your skin . "
the prophet ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) said to him , " do n't you want to be buried here and be with me in paradise ? "
the tree trunk became quiet .
sawad started to kiss the abdomen of the prophet . he said , " this is what i wanted . "
the prophet uncovered his honorable abdomen and said , " avenge yourself , sawad . "

< headline > why is most of the quran addressed to males ?
< poster > yamuslim - owner < msm77777 @ ... >
http://www.islamtoday.net/questions/show_question_content.cfm?id=102303
the title : why is most of the quran addressed to males ?
the respondent : dr. muhammad bin hussein al-jizani , a member of the faculty at the islamic university in medina .
the new classification ; date : 12/01/1427 a.h.
the question : in the quran we often see that god is addressing men . the same is also true in the hadith . why ?
the answer : praise be to god , and blessings and peace be upon the messenger of god . now to the subject :
this question was asked by the mother of the believers , umm salma ( may god be pleased with her ) . she said , " i said to the prophet ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) why are we not mentioned in the quran as men are mentioned ? "
god 's statement was revealed : " male moslems and female moslems , male believers and female believers " ( the confederates : verse 35 , tradition of ahmad 26575 , commentary of al-tabari 22/10 ) .
because the quran was revealed in the language of the arabs and addressed them according to their own rules , women are included in the address to men because the arabs give precedence to the grammatical masculine gender over the feminine .
a man may say , " enter " or " go out , " thereby addressing all those who are present , males and females .
it is not correct in the language of the arabs to say , " enter " [ masculine plural form ] and " enter " [ feminine plural form ] , and " go out " [ masculine plural form ] and " go out " [ feminine plural form ] . "
it is also known from the evidence of the sharia and its intentions that the obligation to obey the rules of sharia is directed to both men and women . all are obligated , addressed , accountable , rewarded , and punished .
this is the regular principle and the general rule : men and women are included in all the rules on an equal basis .
however , there are rules specifically for men , not for women , such as the prohibition of gold and silk , and the duty of observing fridays and jihad .
likewise , there are rules specifically for women , not for men , such as the veil , child care , and other duties , as determined by the nature of both genders . god knows best .

< headline > unsheathed sword against those who insult the prophet
< poster > mohamed khawas < mmakhawas @ ... >
http://www.dorar.net/book_view.asp?book_id=7435 . god 's law regarding those on whom moslems cannot take revenge when they insult the prophet or harm him .
the sheikh al-islam ibn taymiyya , said , " according to god 's law , if believers cannot torture those who harm god and his messenger , then god almighty will take revenge on him for his messenger and rescue his messenger from him . "
the story about god destroying those scorners one by one is well - known and has been mentioned by biographers and commentators . they are , as was said , a group of the chiefs of quraish , including : al-walid ibn al-mughira , al-as ibn wa'il , the two blacks ibn muttalib and ibn abd yaghuth , and al-harith ibn qays .
the prophet ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) wrote to khusrau and caesar , neither of whom converted to islam . but caesar honored the letter of the messenger of god ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) and honored the prophet 's messenger . his monarchy was established . it is said , " his kingship will continue in his offspring until today . "
khusrau tore the letter of the messenger of god ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) and scorned the messenger of god ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) . god killed him a short time later and tore his kingdom into pieces . the dynasty of khusrau had no kingdom . god knows best .
a common saying : " the flesh of scholars is poisoned meat . " how much more is the flesh of the prophets ( may god 's peace be upon them ) .
in the " al-sahih " it is said about the prophet ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) that he said , " god almighty says , ' whoever is hostile to my companion has fought against me . ' " how much more if someone is hostile to the prophets ?
he who fights against god will be fought against .
if you study the stories of the prophets mentioned in the quran , you will find that their nations were destroyed when they harmed the prophets and treated them with bad words or actions . such was the case of the israelites . they were forced into submissiveness and they faced god 's anger . they did not have any supporter because they killed the prophets unjustly , in addition to being infidels , as god mentioned in his book .
perhaps you will find that anyone who has harmed one of the prophets and has not repented will be stricken by a certain calamity from god .
we have mentioned what moslems have tried in order to hasten revenge against infidels if they insult the messenger of god ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) . we have heard about incidents like these in many events . this is a broad subject that cannot be covered . we did not mean to tackle it here . we only wanted to show the legal ruling .
similar incidents have been reported by a number of honest moslems , islamic legal scholars and people of experience , about how they tried many times to besiege fortresses and cities on the shores of syria . when the moslems besieged the tribe of al-asfar during our time , they said , " we used to besiege the fortress or city for one month or more , but the fortress was impossible for us , until we were almost in despair over it . but when its people insulted the prophet ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) and slandered his honor , we captured them quickly and easily ; it barely took longer than one or two days or so . then the place would be taken by force , and a massacre would take place . " they said , " even if we captured them quickly , when we heard them slandering him , our hearts were filled with anger at them because of what they said about him . "
likewise some of our reliable companions told me that moslems in morocco have the same situation with the christians . it is in god 's law that he tortures his enemies , sometimes by torturing them himself and sometimes at the hands of his believers .
god almighty used to protect him and keep him away from the harm and insults of people in every way , even in pronunciation .
in the " sahihayn " it is told that abu huraira said , " the messenger of god ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) said , ' ca n't you see how god removes from me the insults and curses of quraish . they insult in their rebuke and they curse in their rebuke , and i am praised . ' " god kept his name virtuous and described him with regard to the insult , and turned it against the slanderer himself even if he was the one who was doing harm , but his intention was the same thing .
what proves that insulting is a serious crime in addition to being infidel and an act of war - even if it implies that - is that the prophet ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) used to forgive hypocrites who harmed him as mentioned above . he could have killed them as was mentioned in the hadith by abu bakr and others .
if the vituperation was only apostasy , it was necessary to kill him , because the apostate must be killed . he knew that the rightness of the prophet ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) might be made to win in insulting , so he could forgive him .
this proves that insulting is a unique criminal offense . if a free non - moslem living in a moslem country insulted a moslem or a covenanter and violated the covenant , then that man 's insulting would be a serious crime for which he deserves a worse punishment than what he would deserve for merely violating the covenant . therefore , insulting the messenger of god ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) is different from insulting an ordinary person .
he ( may god have mercy on him ) said , " cleansing the earth of any manifestation of insults to the messenger of god ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) is a duty as much as possible because it is part of the full manifestation of the religion of god and the exaltedness of god 's word . since the entire religion belongs to god , whenever it is insulted and there is no revenge against the person who did that , the religion would not be manifest and the word of god would not be exalted . the earth must also be cleansed of fornicators , thieves , and highwaymen as much as possible . this is different from cleansing it of infidels because this is not a duty . we can allow the people of the two books to practice their religion as protected non - moslem subjects in moslem countries who pay the poll tax because allowing them to be protected non - moslem subjects who pay the poll tax obligates them to follow the rule of god and his messenger over them . this is not contrary to revealing the religion and exalting the word . making a truce with the infidel and receiving his protection is allowed in times of weakness or for a desired interest .
the earth must be cleansed of every serious crime as much as possible . the punishment is imposed on the one who committed it according to the specific punishment specified in the islamic religious law . if there is no particular person who has a claim for recompense , the perpetrator must be killed because this serious crime has no specific person with a claim to recompense , but it was against god , his messenger , and all the believers . in this way the difference between the one who insults and the infidel is revealed . it is permitted to allow the infidel who can be allowed to hide among his infidelity but is committed to the rule of god and his messenger . this is not true about the one who insults .
-----------------------
( 1 ) this was in his time ( may god have mercy on him ) .
if the descendants of caesar mock the messenger of god ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) today , then this is good news that their rule and sovereignty will disappear with god 's permission .

< headline > mentioning god in the bathroom
< poster > kg < ghazyk @ ... >
is it permissible for a moslem to read the quran or to think about god without saying it out loud , while he is in the bathroom ?
the answer :
praise be to god
1. there are two kinds of mention of the lord 's name : mention with the tongue , such as reading the quran , reciting liturgical exercises , and reciting prayers which the islamic law encourages , and mention the lord 's name in the heart , by thinking of god almighty , his greatness , and his power , as well as thinking of his creations ( glory to him ) or reciting the quran in one 's mind . doing that does not provide the reward for reading the quran because the reward is linked to reading , which is only done out loud , and , for example , praying , which must be done out loud . it is not enough to pray inwardly .
scholars differentiated between the two kinds of mention of the lord 's name . they said , " it is offensive to mention god almighty out loud in the bathroom because god is too exalted to be mentioned in this place . " as for mentioning god inwardly , they said , " it is not offensive , and there is no objection to it . "
the difference between the two kinds of mention of the lord 's name is shown by the fact that scholars agreed that a person in a state of ritual impurity may recite the quran in his mind , but it is forbidden for him to read it out loud and pronounce it .
al-nawawi said , " they agreed that if a ritually impure person meditated on the quran inwardly without moving his tongue , he is not a reader committing the prohibited reading of the ritually impure . " ( al-nawawi 's interpretation of sahih muslim ) .
ibn al-mundhir said in al-awsat , " akrama said he does not mention god out loud while in the bathroom , but in his mind " ( al-awsat ) .
the permanent committee said , " one of the rules of conduct of islam is for a person to mention his lord whenever he wants to enter the bathroom or the bath by saying before he enters , ' oh god , i take refuge in you against malice and malicious acts . ' he should not mention god after he enters , and he should refrain from mentioning him the moment he enters . " ( fatwas of the permanent committee , 5/93 ) .
sheikh abd al-aziz ibn baz said , " mentioning god in the mind is legitimate any time and any place , in the bathroom or anywhere else . but what is offensive in the bathroom and similar places is mentioning god out loud exalting him , except for mentioning his name during ablution . this is done if it is not possible to perform the ablution outside the bathroom , because it is a duty according to some scholars and a confirmed custom among the public . " ( fatwas of sheikh ibn baz , 5/408 ) . god knows best .
