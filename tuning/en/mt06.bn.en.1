welcome to you to the newscast from al-jazeera channel .
a delegation of leaders of the hamas movement , headed by khaled meshaal , president of the political bureau of the movement , is holding talks with egyptian officials in cairo about developments in the situation in the palestinian territories after the legislative elections , and to confer about the formation of the future palestinian government .
ismail haniya had denied that the egyptian government or the palestinian president had demanded that the movement recognize israel as a pre - condition to forming the next palestinian government .
haniya said that the movement , even though it is committed to its political program and the principles of the palestinian people , is also a realistic and pragmatic movement .
haniya , one of the strongest candidates for the presidential post of the first hamas government in palestine , added that hamas may accept a long - term truce if israel acts to release the palestinian prisoners and stops its policy of assassinations .
uh , there are no pressures being exerted from uh , the sisterly egypt on the islamic resistance movement hamas in connection with the political positions of hamas .
uh , and the relationship between us and uh , egypt is a relationship based on mutual respect , and there were many points when egypt believed in a palestinian - palestinian dialogue , and we would always , you know , agree and reach an understanding under egyptian sponsorship , but there are no pressures being exerted by egypt on the hamas movement .
of course , the hamas movement has its political program on the basis of which it fought the elections , and at the time when it is a custodian of the rights and principles of the palestinian people , it is also at the same time a realistic movement that operates with an open vision and an openness to our arab and islamic , and also regional and international , environment , and it will take the positions and the decisions that will protect the highest interests of the palestinian people .
in the palestinian territories , attorney general ahmad al-mughni said that the investigations of corruption have reached senior officials of the palestinian authority who may have been involved in theft or squandering of public funds worth at least 700 million dollars .
al-mughni said at a press conference that those involved in these cases will be pursued .
the dossier of the cement used to build the separation wall was referred by the legislative council .
the dossier of the middle east pipelines which was referred by the legislative council , and i shall explain to you about this dossier .
we presented this dossier , there are approximately six million dollars , four million dollars is the share of the palestinian national authority , and two million dollars is the share of , uh , the italian authority , the italian government .
this plant exists on paper , but in reality is inexistent .
and here i am , we are searching where these funds were squandered .
and there are serious investigations in this matter .
also the dossiers of embezzlement and false affiliation affiliation , fraud , swindling and counterfeiting of official documents by people of high standing , and their numbers are more than 20 cases , some of which had indictments lodged against them with the competent courts and some others are awaiting the conclusion of the investigation procedures .
also the dossier of the college of forensic medicine in abu deif , and this is a big dossier , and we are investigating it now .
the dossier of the citizen protection society also , there are very big financial embezzlements .
the dossier of the palestinian radio television and satellite authority where embezzlements exceeding 20 million dollars were found .
iran announced that it has suspended all %pw commercial and economic ties with denmark in protest over the cartoons that one of its newspapers ( ( published ) ) that offend the feelings of moslems .
the european union had warned iran that its boycott of danish goods will affect its commercial relations with the countries of the union .
meanwhile , demonstrators again today broke into the sovereign grounds of the danish embassy in tehran and threw molotov cocktails before they left , in protest over the publication of the cartoons that are offensive to the noble prophet .
[ ]
for the second day in a row , iranian demonstrators vented their anger at the danish embassy , breaking into it and attacking it with molotov cocktails in protest over the publication by danish newspapers of cartoons that are offensive to the messenger mohammad ibn abdullah , the prayers of god be upon him .
the attack on the danish embassy is thought to be the second of its kind targeting a western embassy in tehran , as about 200 student demonstrators yesterday pelted the austrian embassy with stones , breaking glass windows and starting small fires inside . the austrian mission was targeted because austria is the current president of the european union .
denmark has protested to iran because of the two attacks on its embassy and has demanded that tehran protect its diplomats , while the european union escalated its pressures on arab and islamic countries to control such protests and reminded 19 countries of a treaty obligating them to protect diplomatic missions .
thousands of other moslems in all parts of the world joined to participate in the protests denouncing the insult to the prophet of islam , some of which were dominated by aspects of violence as it happened in the afghan capital kabul , when police troops assailed the demonstrators with cudgels as they pelted the danish diplomatic mission with stones , and several of them were arrested .
the kabul protest had been preceded on monday by a protest outside bagram , the american military base in afghanistan , during which the afghan forces fired at the demonstrators , killing four of them and injuring at least 19 others .
the bagram protest is believed to be the first of its kind against an american target .
and while protests began spreading in various parts of the islamic world , the administration of american president george bush appealed to the kingdom of saudi arabia to use its influence to help in reducing tensions in the middle east and europe .
denmark has called on its subjects in ten islamic countries to leave , against the background of a continuation of the angry demonstrations on account of the publication by a danish newspaper of cartoons that are offensive to the noble prophet .
the crisis between denmark and the islamic world has escalated and went beyond the ability of denmark to contain it in spite of its diplomatic mobilization .
[ ]
denmark did not imagine , even in its most miserable nightmares , that the issue of the caricature cartoons that are offensive to the noble messenger will enflame such repercussions with all their implications .
it was shocked by the scenes of the danish embassy and consulate in damascus and beirut as they burned , according to the reports of the danish media , and it was surprised by the magnitude of islamic anger in various regions of the world .
scenes that made danish foreign minister per stig moeller describe the situation as grave and admit that the crisis has transcended denmark .
it is a crisis much bigger than denmark , it threatens the cooperation between the islamic and western worlds .
the danish authorities thought that the apology by the newspaper jyllands - posten , which published the cartoons , would suffice , and also the hosting by the danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen of the ambassadors of islamic countries in copenhagen to calm the popular and official islamic mindsets , but it seems that it was not sufficient .
and while waiting for the diplomatic mobilization that was initiated by denmark at more than one level to achieve a calming of the situation , copenhagen has realized that it will pay out of the pocket of its interests and economy a tax for its silence over the violation of the religious feelings of moslems on its territory .
one billion 600 million dollars is the loss that danish companies stand to lose if the shelves of stores in islamic countries remain empty of danish milk and its cheeses , for example .
however , the issue does not stop at the economic boycott of danish products . the real shock may perhaps be caused by official american and british condemnations of the publication of the cartoons .
condemnations that could undermine the big efforts that denmark spent over a period of years in order to lay the foundation for a policy of privileged alliance with the united states , which made it known in europe as the voice of america .

the french magazine charlie hebdo re - published today the caricature cartoons that are offensive to the noble prophet and said it did that to support the democratic right of freedom of expression .
the magazine condemned in its opening editorial what it considered an attempt by extremists at extracting concessions on democratic principles .
meanwhile , jacques chirac , the french president , accused the newspapers that published those cartoons , he accused them of provocation on the grounds that this will inflame feelings in a dangerous manner .
in indonesia , the foreign minister said that the publication of the cartoons that are offensive to the noble prophet was an opportunity seized by radical groups to put the situation out of control . this statement concurs with what danish prime minister ( ( rasmussen ) ) asserted yesterday about the presence of elements that are pouring oil on the fire for the sake of their own agenda , in a direct allusion to the existence of a political and religious exploitation of these protest demonstrations .
[ ]
there had to be a justification for all these protests that are invading the streets of the islamic world and for the magnitude of the anger that has prevented listening to the western calls for calm .
a justification offered by the danish prime minister ( ( anders fogh rasmussen ) ) yesterday when he talked about the existence of extremists pouring oil on the fire for the sake of what he called their own agenda .
the indonesian foreign minister did not differ much with him today in his announcement that the publication of cartoons offensive to the noble prophet created an opportunity that the extremists exploited to spin the situation out of control .
[ ]
two statements that seemingly relied on indicators monitored by observers , including the slogans raised here in iran targeting denmark , but also the united states , israel and austria which presides over the european union and hosts the headquarters of the international atomic energy agency .
the scene in iran was read as though it were an attempt at exploiting the religious feelings in order to mobilize against those who are trying to isolate iran based on its nuclear dossier .
the same conspiracy theory was used to justify the depth of the demonstrations in syria and lebanon . a group of lebanese politicians hurried to accuse damascus of being behind the demonstrations .
however , there is more than one angle on these demonstrations . for example , those classified as extremists by the west were not always leading the demonstrators .
in gaza , activists of fatah , then of islamic jihad , were the main drivers of the demonstrations .
in beirut , the scene of clergymen trying to restrain the urge of the demonstrators was often repeated .
in france too , the position of the french islamic council appeared reserved in comparison with the position of organizations that are classified in the category of secular organizations .
and regardless of the angle with which these demonstrations are followed and the interpretations that are offered for each one of them , the anger of that young moslem man coming from the injury by others to his deep true religious feelings remains dominant over the entire picture .
in afghanistan today , four people at least were killed and 20 others were injured during a demonstration denouncing the caricature cartoons that are offensive to the noble prophet in the province of zabul in the south of afghanistan after confrontations with the police .
an afghan security official said that the police fired in the air to disperse 600 demonstrators after they pelted the police with stones . with this , the number of deaths increases to ten in the demonstrations that afghanistan experienced during last week .
the secretary general of the united nations , kofi annan , the secretary general of the islamic conference organization , ekmeleddin oglu , and the high representative of foreign policy at the european union , javier solana , expressed in a press statement , a copy of which was received by al-jazeera , they expressed their grave concerns regarding the repercussions of the publication of the cartoons that are offensive to the noble prophet and the angry reactions against that .
the statement added that we believe that the freedom of the press requires having a sense of responsibility and rationality , and the obligation to respect all religions and describe the recent acts of violence as having crossed the boundaries of peaceful protest .
the statement also denounced the attacks against the diplomatic missions in damascus and beirut , and called on the authorities to protect the diplomatic facilities and foreign residents .
the secretary general of the united nations , kofi annan , requested american assistance from american president george bush for dispatching an international force to darfur , and annan said that the issue of protecting the displaced and securing the delivery of aid requires the cooperation of all governments .
the appreciation by american president george bush for what he described as the fine leadership of the secretary general of the united nations , and his great optimism for the success of democracy and freedom in the world , were met with kofi annan 's request for american assistance to dispatch an international force to darfur .
i am very happy that we have agreed to work together on the question of darfur and to work with other governments from europe , asia and other regions to secure an effective security presence on the ground to protect the displaced and guarantee the arrival of aid to the needy , and that is of course an issue in which all governments have to play a role .
the role that annan wants president bush to support is to assemble an international force to stop the acts of violence in the darfur region , in the west of sudan . moreover , the proposed force , as annan wants it , must have great capability for movement in the air and on the ground with good communications equipment from european countries and the united states to replace the african union force that is now protecting the civilians in darfur .
and in spite of the announcement by the united nations that the humanitarian situation in the regions that have been the scene of fighting since 2003 improved last year , hundreds of thousands of people remain in need of relief despite of the tons of assistance of the world food program . also , the growth rate among the children of darfur has dropped from about 4% to 1.4% during 2005 , and the number of children who had access to schools has increased three - fold .
relief operations officials at the united nations believe that 3.5 million people , most of whom are displaced , were helped by more than 14,000 humanitarian workers , and they add that the protection of civilians constitutes a great challenge .
officials at the united nations fear the state of instability in the west of darfur on the borders with chad , where no less than 300,000 people have been unable to benefit from humanitarian assistance .
the conflict in darfur has led after three years of the crisis to the death of approximately 300,000 people and the displacement and refuge - seeking of more than a million of the inhabitants of the region , and no one knows if annan 's proposals would this time be able to solve it .
turkey , uh , is the scene of an early debate on the presidential elections which will be held in april of next year .
the opposition believes that the current parliamentary composition enables the ruling justice and development party to monopolize the nomination of the next president , who will be elected by the parliament according to the constitution .
in contrast , the government is rejecting calls by the opposition to hold early parliamentary elections that precede the selection of the president of the republic .
the comfortable numerical majority that the ruling justice and development party enjoys makes it eligible to elect a new president of the republic after the term of president ahmad nejdat sezar comes to an end in the spring of next year .
according to the turkish constitution , the parliament nominates and elects the president of the republic .
this fact has come to worry the opposition that does not want to see an islamist seated in the presidential palace , and it began demanding the holding of early elections on the argument that the current composition of parliament does not reflect the opinion of the people .
the ruling justice and development party obtained 34% of the votes in the last elections , but is represented in the parliament at the proportion of 66% of the seats because of the parliamentary threshold law , which means it can elect whoever it wants as a president without consideration for the opinion of 65% of the people who did not vote for the justice and development party . this is not fair .
the ruling justice and development party rejects the referral to early elections whose results may alter the current composition of the parliament , and it insists that it will be the one to choose the new president of the country .
we have no intention whatsoever in holding early parliamentary elections before the selection of the president of the republic . the constitution gives us that right and we will not forfeit it .
the president of the republic in turkey does not have broad executive powers , but he presides over the national security council and appoints the bureaucratic leaderships of the state on educational and judicial institutions and others . these are powers that the justice and development party needs to continue its reform program in turkey .
also , the islamic street in turkey will not forgive the justice and development party for missing this opportunity ; opinion polls indicate that the base of the party sets among its priorities the election of an islamist president from its own ranks to sit in the presidential palace as a moral victory over the secular ataturkish forces in turkey .
the electoral expectation of an islamist president for turkey means that the hopes and dreams of the political islamist movement in turkey have not yet ended , and the influence and positions obtained by the justice and development party is but a step on a long road .

five people were killed and tens injured in demonstrations targeting western interests in protest of the failure of denmark to apologize for the offensive cartoons .
indonesian importers have decided to boycott danish goods to protest these cartoons .
and in spite of the attempts of the european union to calm the feelings of moslems , western politicians are escalating the situation with their comments and positions .
in protest over the offensive cartoons , pakistani demonstrators drew this cartoon of the city of bishago .
tens killed and injured after the intervention of police and special guards .
they did not distinguish between norwegian , american and korean commercial and services offices .
they are protesting the offensive cartoons and are demanding an official danish apology .
in pakistan , another protest aimed at being peaceful and creative .
a donkey race in which each donkey bears the picture of a western leader .
in the philippines , where islam arrived thanks to arab traders , protests continued , and although their clothes appeared western for the most part , the protest was intense over the offensive cartoons .
they tried to be creative when insulting the symbols of denmark , but burning alone was not sufficient anymore , and they made flags to tear them later on with fervor .
we moslems are ready to fight those who mock our prophet , god 's prayer and peace be upon him .
fighting .
fighting is what the european union does not want .
javier solana visited arab countries and made general comments there about respecting islam .
but the continued re - publishing and issuing of new western positions doom solana 's mission , and some european parliamentarians oppose even the peaceful means of protest .
that is , the boycott of the goods of denmark is considered as a boycott of the goods of the european union .
an italian minister was heard to say that he intended to wear a shirt with the offensive cartoons , considering this as his invitation to dialogue .
the cartoon affair with the west started with a new iranian site publishing a cynical cartoon on the holocaust .
the danish newspaper jyllands - posten is not printing the winning cartoons .
the danish government will face a difficult test if the paper later decides to publish the holocaust cartoon , since the danish government has said that danish governments do not interfere with the press .
the swedes , neighbors to denmark , officially entered the fray by closing a site that was publishing the cartoons . western politicians oppose the re - publication .
it appears that positions are motivated by their interest and safety , since these moves came after the peaceful and violent demonstrations and the boycott campaign .
an electronic web site publishes hundreds of additional photos about the torture at abu ghraib prison , after the ones aired by an australian television station .
but the us defense department said that there is no need to stir up a new uproar about what it described as old photos .
the scandal coincides with the suggestion by the united nations to shut down another notorious american prison at guantanamo , which the bush administration has refused to do .
the american administration has defended , is defending , and will defend the guantanamo prison in spite of strong criticisms .
a legal report of the united nations had demanded the immediate closure of the prison .
they basically looked at questions such as : are they detained arbitrarily or legally ? the conclusion was that they are detained in an illegal manner .
indictments must be lodged against them , and they should be given the opportunity to defend themselves .
and i think that guantanamo will have to be closed sooner or later .
the official american response is expected to be ' no ' to a closure of the prison . the detainees are treated humanely , and on top of that , blame is directed at the un team .
the un team was granted permits to visit the guantanamo prison , but its members refused to go there .
the red cross visits the detainees freely .
what maclennan refused to clarify is that the red cross distributes its reports only to the detention authorities , which is why the red cross did not expose any scandal pertaining to the treatment of prisoners in guantanamo .
as to the united nations team , it refused to visit guantanamo because its members were not permitted to be alone with the detainees .
human rights organizations are concerned about us attempts to re - define torture , and for the us military to be the prosecutors , the judges , the attorneys , and maybe the executioners later .
even the european parliament unanimously demanded the application of international law to the guantanamo detainees .
in the name of humanity , this prison should be shut down , they should be tried in a fair trial or released if nothing is proven against them .
the united nations report came right after the publication of a torture photo of iraqi youths at a british prison in basra , coinciding with new photos of past tortures at abu ghraib .
but the us defense secretary sees no need to stir up an uproar .
these photos are nothing more than those we saw the first time and those who perpetrated this conduct have been punished .
when you torture and beat with this savagery , you are no different from dictatorial regimes .
perhaps the greatest embarrassment in the guantanamo and abu ghraib cases theoretically falls to arab countries who relinquished their citizens .
the iraqi government effectively denounced what is happening in abu ghraib and has demanded that the prison be handed to it in order to manage it by itself .
but its record in al-jadiriyah and news about death squads will make the choice difficult for the detainees between an american jailer and another non - american jailer .
and the talk about the existence of al-qaeda groups in lebanon is linked to the arrest by the lebanese security services of a number of people who believe in that orientation and who formed groups on the ground , some of which , the investigations have shown , were preparing for military actions .
but the most important point in this case is the information that continues to be reiterated about the link between a group that was arrested in beirut and the assassination of the martyr president rafik hariri .
two fundamentalist groups that are considered likely to be affiliated with the al-qaeda organization are currently in the custody of the security services and the lebanese judiciary system , and investigations are ongoing on members of those two groups %pw ( ( - ) ) .
the first group is composed of five people , four lebanese and one syrian known as abu - qatada , and they were arrested in the town of ( ( bir'aya ) ) in the north . information indicates that these were present in iraq and were imprisoned by the american forces for about six months . one of them had a leg amputated as a result of a mine explosion .
the second group was arrested in beirut and is composed of 13 people of various arab nationalities who possessed weapons , counterfeit travel documents , and called each other by fake names .
and according to security sources , they are
one , the leader of the group , hassan mohammad nabaa , had participated in the events of ( ( deniyyeh ) ) in 2000 and escaped to syria . his two brothers participated in the demonstration on sunday .
two , amer abdallah hallaq , a palestinian mechanical engineer .
three , hani hashem al-shanti , naturalized of palestinian origin , and he is a computer engineer .
four , hamad turki ( ( al-rubaa ) ) , a syrian .
five , mohammad abdel razzaq wafa'i , a syrian .
six , faysal assaad akbar , a saudi national who entered lebanon with a fake passport under the name of fahd mohammad al-khadem al-yamani . he fought in the ranks of al-qaeda in afghanistan , then moved to syria .
seven , mohammad ahmad kawja , a syrian .
eight , tareq al-nasser , a syrian neurosurgeon who accompanied some of those men to iraq .
nine , ali jihad sharafeddin , a lebanese minor whose task is to transport explosives .
ten , khodr mohammad nabaa , a lebanese .
eleven , malek mohammad nabaa , was in charge of assembling the explosives ' bags and detonation equipment .
twelve , bara ' mohammad fouad , a syrian .
thirteen , muaath abdel ghani shusha , a syrian .
the information says that all of these are connected to one syrian person from homs known as jamil , and he is an expert in electronics engineering , explosives and booby - trapping . he supplied the fighters going to iraq with weapons and money , and the information also revealed the two most dangerous members of this group , khaled taha and bilal zaaroura , entered lebanon from syria last december , and they are likely located in the ain al-helwe camp . they were never arrested .
a lot of information is woven around the investigation on members of this group about their involvement in the assassination of president rafik hariri . the international inquiry commission and the american side have requested to examine this information which may come from a highly placed judiciary authority .
members of this group remain in the custody of the information branch at the internal security forces , that accompany them to the military investigative judge to continue investigating them for the crime of planning to carry out terrorist operations .
however , the manner with which this file is being handled suggests as though there is internal information pertaining to the assassination , but the judiciary sources do not confirm this information because they do not have material evidence , and they say that the issue is political talk aimed at shifting the accusation from one place to another .
good evening .
hezbollah , which %pw declined to participate in a demonstration sunday , benefited from the scene of unrest and disturbances to present today a contrasting image with a packed and organized crowd in the hundreds of thousands .
and in addition to this point of organization and order , the secretary general of hezbollah hassan nasrallah forged ahead , leaning on the momentum of the mar mikhail 's meeting with general aoun , in a political assault on those he described as the current custodians of power , calling on them to admit to the facts produced by the recent developments and accusing some of those who manage the state to contributing to the straining of the political and sectarian atmosphere .
nasrallah , who feels a renewed political security , proclaimed a program of priorities for the coming phase , in which most importantly is a call to those who want to wage war with syria or against syria to benefit from his party or his faction or his group . but it is not permissible , according to nasrallah , to drag the government and the state and its institutions into a war of this kind .
in contrast , and hours after the political and popular show of force by hezbollah , prime minister fouad siniora sought to continue cleaning up the aftermath of last sunday by convening a religious summit that is being held at this moment in the grand serail .
for more information , we have a direct correspondence from that location with colleague denise rahme - fakhry .
denise , good evening .
good evening , george .
yes , at this time the summit has not started yet , but it is only a few moments from beginning , while waiting for all the personalities or all the heads of the denominations participating in this summit in the grand serail , which is sponsored by the prime minister %pw , pardon , prime minister fouad siniora .
therefore , uh , among , uh , the heads of the participating denominations is maronite patriarch cardinal mar nasrallah boutros sfeir , the mufti of the lebanese republic sheikh mohammad rashid qabbani , deputy chairman of the supreme shiite islamic council sheikh abdel majid qabalan , patriarch gregorios iii laham , patriarch of antioch , all the east , alexandria and jerusalem for the greek catholics .
also participating is patriarch nerses bedros xix , patriarch of the armenian catholics , and dr. salim sahyouni , president of the supreme council of the evangelical denomination in syria and lebanon .
also participating are bishop elias audi , bishop boulos matar , bishop kegham khatcherian , and also bishop roland abou jaoudeh .
participating from the druze denomination is judge nouhad hariz . participating also are bishop mar narsai d'baz , bishop mar athanasios ephrem barsoum , i apologize if i am saying the name wrong , bishop michel kassarji , bishop boulos dahdah , monsignor george al-masri , bishop andre haddad , and abbot , uh , bishaoui , head of the qodsi denomination in lebanon and syria .
therefore , these names are participating in this spiritual gathering or spiritual summit as described by george .
as we learned , there will be an important speech during this summit delivered by prime %pw minister fouad siniora , who has refused to divulge its contents before reading it in front of the attendees .
following the gathering , we have also learned , there will be a dinner hosted by president siniora in honor of all the heads of the denominations participating today in this gathering at the grand serail .
george .
the saint maroun church in gemmayzeh , which was subject to acts of disturbance last sunday , commemorated today the feast of saint maroun day with an official celebratory mass that gathered the lebanese parties led by the two presidents emile lahoud and fouad siniora , and a representative of president berri .
the celebration of saint maroun day returns this year while lebanon is going through difficult circumstances .
the feast gathered at the saint maroun church in gemmayzeh all of the spiritual families of lebanon .
the president of the republic general emile lahoud , prime minister fouad siniora , and abdel latif zein , representing the speaker of parliament , all attended the event ..
also participating in the holy eucharist was a large number of ministers , members of parliament , and political , union , social , media and spiritual figures , and the ambassadors of the foreign powers .
presiding over the divine eucharist was bishop boulos matar who said that the tradition of gathering to pray at the saint maroun church in beirut goes back three - quarters of a century , and its persistence is but a sign that the lebanese , in spite of their differences , are bound to each other by love .
what is required today is not to defame others with treason or unconstructive attacks . rather , what is required is love .
the security we lost in our capital for hours , and the feeling people had of being without a roof to protect their necks , their livelihood and what they hold as sacred , has sharply question what we have been trying to prove for 30 years , during which we almost lost everything , we shed abundant blood and tears in the hope that a bright tomorrow will dawn on us and our generations in a safe , stable and completely sovereign country and in a capable and just state .
so is it reasonable that we have to wait longer after all that ?
bishop matar stressed the need for continued dialogue in consultation with people and across the multiplicity of opinions in search for the best solutions as seen by the majority of the citizens .
for the majority does not bring people together on the basis of their religious affiliations or the like , but rather on the basis of their opinions .
and it is transferred by handing power from one side to another without difficulty to anyone .
the game of free minds and hearts , and free wills , increases in value whenever the group increases its rationality and the practice of its freedoms .
and undoubtedly , it is the soundest basis to identify the welfare of the group because it brings everyone into the search and the decision .
it also prescribes on the majority , any majority , to take into consideration the opinion of the minority and the integration of both prior to any disagreement .
prayers were held at the occasion in order to lay the foundation for love in lebanon and peace in its regions .
and in ( ( bkerki ) ) the maronite patriarch cardinal sfeir stressed in his holiday sermon the need for solidarity in these tough oppressive days in lebanon .
we celebrate today the feast of saint maroun , the father of our maronite church , and the best way to celebrate the saints is to follow the example of their lives .
the words of the maronite patriarch cardinal mar nasrallah boutros sfeir .
during his presiding of the celebratory mass at the church of the patriarchal seat at the occasion of the celebration of the feast of saint maroun , it was an occasion to recall the life of saint maroun which was characterized by giving , prayer , asceticism and the struggle against the temptations of the world and its sins .
cardinal sfeir called the lebanese to show solidarity in these tough oppressive days .
as we express our strong regrets for what happened last sunday in the capital beirut in terms of destruction , demolition and violations , which were sought to ignite the fire of strife , we praise god that the citizens in their awareness knew how to avoid its evil .
we congratulate our brothers and sons the maronites for this feast , here at home and in their lands of emigration , near and far , and we call on all of them to emulate the virtues of this saint , especially for his distinct fear of god , his detachment from the sins of the world and his love of people .
and he always said , in the presence of the almighty , we are useless slaves , amen .
after the celebratory mass for the feast of saint maroun , the faithful and the well - wishers moved to the patriarchal seat where cardinal sfeir welcomed the representative of the french ambassador , francois abi saad , the former member of parliament estephan al-doueihi , in addition to a delegation from the lebanese forces from ghadir .
also speaking was the secretary of a delegation of maronite clergy graduates in ghadir .
the circumstances are very difficult , and what is being schemed against this nation has become known , and there are some who do not want tranquility for its sons .
but we should close our ranks together and know that there is strength in unity and weakness in partisanship .
israel strongly rejected the invitation by russian president vladimir putin to the hamas movement leaders to come to moscow to discuss the peace process in the middle east .
for its part , washington expressed its caution regarding the russian initiative and renewed its position that hamas is a terrorist organization , while france saw that the initiative of putin could bolster the position of the quartet committee , though this initiative %pw was taken without consulting with the members of the committee .
the international attempts at encircling the hamas movement after its victory in the palestinian legislative elections were breached by russia in a striking manner , so from madrid the russian president vladimir putin promised to invite the leaders of hamas soon to moscow to discuss the future of the peace process between the palestinians and the israelis .
hamas was never in our view a terrorist organization .
and we have to admit that hamas took power in the palestinian territories by way of democratic and legitimate elections .
and we have to respect the decision of the palestinian people to find solutions that the palestinian parties can agree on .
and while an official at the russian foreign ministry said that moscow will call the hamas movement to change its radical policy , including its recognition of israel , the russian side was met with an immediate welcome from hamas .
we are desirous of relations with %pw all the countries of %pw the international and regional countries , and we are also happy to visit russia and , you know , to discuss and consult with the %pw russian government and president .
tel aviv strongly rejected the initiative by putin and considered it an effective stab in the back of israel .
the israeli minister of education meir sheetrit believed that the goal of the initiative is to grant international legitimacy to a terrorist group , according to his expression .
russia must withdraw from any negotiations about peace in the middle east , and he suggested that president putin retract his decision to invite leaders of terrorist organizations that are involved in killing .
the israeli position intersected with the position of washington which expressed its caution about the russian initiative .
they have to recognize israel and renounce terrorism and abide by the international agreements that the palestinian authority signed . we expect russia , as a member of the quartet committee , to send the same message .
for his part , the us assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs , david welsh , noted that his country will reconsider its assistance to the palestinians in case hamas forms the new government .
welsh considered that the agreement by hamas to a long - term truce with the hebrew state will not be sufficient .
the president of the executive committee of the lebanese forces , dr. samir geagea , asserted that to the extent that the forces waged the war with ugliness , they will also wage peace with ugliness .
%pw geagea , and in front of ( ( partisans ) ) of the lebanese forces in the region of aley , announced the continuation of work for the sake of reaching a consensual candidate in replacement of the late member of parliament edmond ( ( eid . ) )
dr. samir geagea confirmed the continued consultation and search of a consensual candidate to avoid an election battle in baabda - aley .
( ( the address ) ) of the president of the executive committee of the lebanese forces came during a meeting that gathered the cadres in the aley region as part of the periodic preparatory meetings to restructure the lebanese forces party .
we are at the present time engaged in a very serious attempt to arrive at a candidate to avoid an election battle , even though it would be a democratic battle , and arrive at a candidate who satisfies all the parties .
( ( your received it ) ) now , a candidate who satisfies all the concerned parties , and of course we respect all the concerned parties , particularly the free patriotic movement , a consensual candidate requires that we sit in a closed room and discuss all the proposed and the non - proposed names .
the proposed and the non - proposed , so we both arrive , with what we represent , we will arrive at a name that is acceptable by both parties .
in what concerns us , there would thus be consensus . we sit down , we propose a name or two , three , 15 , it could reach ( ( up to ) ) 15 , 20 maybe , until we get to a name that satisfies us and satisfies the remaining parties who are concerned with the battle .
this is what we are trying to do at the present time , putting all our weight into it , focusing on it in a final way , and we are trying to reach it .
i wanted in all simplicity and in all honesty for you to be informed , but at the same time i reiterate my saying to you , this does not mean that you should not prepare for legislative elections , in case this initiative does not lead to the expected result .
dr. geagea also addressed two fundamental issues that are being debated on the political stage today , which include the issue of the economic situation and the need to find and implement an effective solution . and the second issue is the wait - and - see policy and self - control for which the lebanese forces are calling after the latest events .
today we have waged the war with courage , and to the extent that we waged the war with courage , we want to wage peace with courage , and peace requires a much greater courage than the courage for war .
the issue is not always one of machismo as we know it , there are times when self - control and remaining calm require much more courage than putting one 's finger on the trigger and firing .
( as anyone can shoot ) , but not everyone can control themselves ( ( so as not to shoot ) ) . some criticize us that we abandon the economic and social situation , and we are doing politics .
the answer is that it is not possible to think of serious economic solutions and serious social solutions outside the framework of an effective and capable state .
because for every solution you think of , you can bring all the experts of the world and they come up with all the solutions for you that one can imagine . but these solutions need someone to implement them , who will implement them , they need an effective state to implement them ; we still do n't have this effective state .
the president of the executive committee of the lebanese forces met at his residence in the cedars with the british ambassador james watt for an hour . the british ambassador did not make any statement .
uh , i apologize - before we continue the newscast , about an error in the introduction to the report about the position of dr. samir geagea who affirmed that the forces , to the extent that they waged %pw the war with courage , they will wage peace with courage also , this error was the result of an error in the print .
[ ]
the president of the executive committee of the lebanese forces , dr. samir geagea , talked on the naharkum saiid program about what he called a rescue plan to liberate the presidency of the republic .
a multifaceted plan because ( ( what i see in it ) ) the situation in the country remains , uh , in a state of stagnation .
of course , the position of the president of the republic is a central position , in contrast ( to what many believe ) . from this perspective , if we were to hope for any improvement of the situation in the country , we have to start from this position .
now the components of this plan are of course still under study , but its fundamental elements will be constitutional , legal , political and popular .
um .
ok , and what is its timeframe , i mean is there a specified timeframe for this plan ?
not much .
not much , of course , uh , an initiative of this kind , a plan of this kind , i mean , one cannot estimate when exactly it will be complete , but we can estimate when it can start .
um .
um .
ok , general michel aoun said yesterday that the extension for president lahoud was forced , likewise the electoral law was forced , do you agree with this comparison ?
no , and this , i mean , this comparison is not , is not accurate and is unscientific .
the extension for president lahoud was forced in the sense that a bunch of intelligence men came ( ( grabbed members of parliament ) ) , threatened them and told them you have to sign on the extension law , whereas the electoral law of 2000 was submitted by parliament , there was a second law proposed , which is law number 60 , and after a give and take , there was a political compromise .
i repeat again , intelligence men did not come , grabbed members of parliament and told them you have to go and sign on the law of 2000 . no. there was a political compromise from the standpoint of ( ( the need ) ) of everyone to hold the elections on time , ok ( ( here goes the country in a constitutional vacuum . ) )
and from the standpoint of , uh , president berri using his position to pass the law of 2000 because ( ( how ) ) it was convenient for him , the most convenient law that suited him , the parties had to come up with a political compromise , and of course , a political compromise is one thing and the forced extension in the sense of %pw , because of oppression and coercion is another completely different thing .
therefore , the law of 2000 , which we of course do not agree , came from the standpoint of a %pw political compromise that took place then , according to the circumstances that prevailed .
mp boutros harb considered that resolution 1559 puts the president of the republic in an illegal situation and i find it odd that general michel aoun is calling for holding early parliamentary elections .
mp boutros harb says that the letter he sent ( ( ) ) to the president of the republic general emile lahoud at christmas was interpreted by president lahoud as though it was in support of him , and since he did not proceed to take the decision to step down , the march 14th forces had to open the file of the presidency in a serious manner .
uh , of course , we hope that the president of the republic realizes this situation and its danger , and the very negative results for lebanon if it were to stay in the same situation , %pw and he is the one who would inflict great harm to the presidency , let alone personal harm to him , i mean the president . because any panel , any panel we see on television is %pw , is %pw , is directing really offensive and insulting words , in addition to that it is the position of the presidency has become an absentee from , absentee , i mean , inexistent in the political life , except in the statements that are issued to respond to this or that . this is of course more harmful to the presidency , uh , and to his negative positions which he sends as responses to the laws that come out of parliament , regardless of whether or not he has the right to respond .
harb mentioned several ways to deal with the issue of the presidency . there are the two aspects , the constitutional and the legal , and there is the political and the popular action .
( ( sheikh ) ) , can we know what is this constitutional and legal mechanism that you are adopting ? will you adopt what came down in 1559 , in the two reports by ( ( larsen ) ) and ( ( mehlis ) ) ? what will you basically adopt to dismiss the president of the republic ?
1559 stipulates the obligation of holding free presidential elections in the respect of the provisions of the constitution .
what happened with the elections , the second day after the resolution was issued , it is in complete violation %pw %pw of one of the articles of this resolution , and this means that the president of the republic , internationally , his presence is in violation of 1559 , and this is in opposition to the international trend and international legitimacy . this is , of course , a big point for which there could be political interaction with him in a way that leads in the end to put the president of the republic in an illegal situation towards the international community , and consequently dealing with him will be on that basis , but this is something that has not yet happened . in fact , we were keen that it does not happen , because we thought that we would reach this attempt , and as a result we were keen that the president of the republic himself took the initiative because the reality in which he is , is not enviable , you know .
( ( sheikh ) ) , but %pw , general aoun , i mean , who was against the extension and was opposing the president of the republic , is now opposing the dismissal of the president , and instead of calling for presidential elections , he now is calling for early parliamentary elections . well , what is your reply to this proposition ?
what is %pw the purpose of the elections ?
we are going back %pw
i mean , there could come out a composition that is different from the present political composition , such that someone could have more , and another could have less . that is not what is required .
what is required is that we benefit from the international support for ( ( lebanon ) ) and from the resulting national circumstance , which was made clear yesterday on february 14 and this , this patriotic pairing for the first time it is happening in the history of lebanon ( ( for the births ) ) in lebanon first ( ( for the births ) ) in lebanon the one free sovereign independent , i mean , the history of lebanon is witnessing a great thing which we should not miss ( ( ) ) .
there are still men in this country .
none of us can pretend to be the only good person and all the other persons are not good .
there are a lot of good people in lebanon , and there are people with whom we agree and with whom we can reach an understanding .
our concern is for the interests of lebanon , any person we can agree on that guarantees the interests of lebanon , we should all relinquish our personal demands and relinquish our orientations , and let us , to the contrary , exert our effort to agree on someone that carries with him our common program for building a modern country and consecrate sovereignty and independence , and re - establish the authority of the state over all of lebanon ; this is the program we should carry , not carry personal agendas .
harb believed that on the subject of the presidency , it is not the person that matters , but the program and the history of that person , his aspirations and his ability to deal positively with all the forces .
