human rights are basic principles and great values we have been careful to list in the constitutional reform presented to our people , so the country 's constitution is a mirror of the noble references of our political system , reflecting our civilized project , the development of our society and its enlightened integration with the highest level of the values produced by mankind .
those values that we listed in the constitution and adopted , as there is no going back on them , emphasize our view that is based on the fact that civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights are all important as well as the fact that these rights complement each other and none is more important than the other .
in it , we reject discrimination in all its forms , and the policy of double standards with all its problems , as much as we reject privacy as a cover for ignoring those values and cosmic principles . we reject that the same principles and values are an entryway into canceling cultural and civilization privacy of peoples .
the creation of an advisors council is an expansion of the forms of people 's representation in the legislative authority , and an entrenchment of the principle of participation as a base for democratic practice . it is , at the same time , keeping up with the development witnessed by parties in all fields , and an interaction with the liveliness of the civil society over the years of change .
it is also a development of the legislative authority in its formation and the forms of representation , supporting the values of the republic and enhancing its institutions . it gives a higher status to the live forces and national abilities .
this council will give the word to trade organizations through its members , including workers , peasants and farmers , organizations that are full of energies and have an ancient history of struggle .
the building of a society of information and communication constitutes for tunisia an essential national option we have worked to entrench as part of a comprehensive approach through continuous structural reforms and the support of the basic structure of communication and information technology in our country , as one of the most prominent bases of the information economy and a principle factor in pushing the system of growth .
we have been careful in principle to develop human resources through a comprehensive plan to spread media teaching at various educational levels and to establish higher academies for technology studies .
that is in addition to condensing the formation of specialists in communications and information , and developing their abilities to absorb modern technology and employ it for the service of development , as well as focusing technology experts and the span of renewed projects all over the country .
we have also focused our efforts on spreading digital technology at the widest range thanks to the regular programs in various media means , creating media centers specialized for children all over the republic , and linking educational institutions at primary , secondary and university phases with the internet , in addition to spreading media and internet clubs in cultural fields , and creating a network of internet centers open to the public .
as well as offering average income families facilities and incentives to own family computers on a wide scale .
the relations of tunisia with the united states of america are distinguished and traditional , based on mutual trust and respect . they are relations that go back to the eighteenth century , specifically the year 1797 , the date of the first trade agreement between tunisia and the united states .
there is no doubt that my visit to this friendly state , which we respect and admire , comes as part of regular and intensive talks and communications between officials of the two countries at the highest level , and are part of the strong relations between the two sides .
we believe that tunisia , from its distinguished geographic location as a bridge that connects the banks of the mediterranean , and the legislature and the incentives it offers to investors provides the ideal base for more investments and mutual projects .
the message we carry with us comes from tunisia 's past and present . we stress our firm country 's belief in the values of justice , freedom and democracy , and the constant seeking of peace and stability in the world on the basis of solidarity and forgiveness among the nations and peoples . these are values we agree on with the friendly american people .
i note at the beginning that there is no presence of delay in the field of democracy and freedom of expression in tunisia on the basis that every democratic society coincides with comprehensive developmental work .
they are two courses we have been concerned with developing firmly and consistently without preferring one to the other . therefore we established a systematic approach to link together civil and political rights with social , economic and cultural rights , because we realize that human dignity is not achieved without reasons for honorable living , including the entrenchment of the rights to health , education , work , habitat , family protection , children and women , and supporting needy social groups who have no support , while guaranteeing the right to freedom of expression , political and trade organization and enhancing democracy and polarity .
the economic and social development would not have been achieved if the opinions of people in our country did not have weight , their rights sanctity and their dignity a place .
we gradually entrenched democratic building to fortify it against any reaction and setback , and we took into consideration the failed experiments of others and what threatened our country and the stability and development of our society including dangers of currents hiding behind religion .
we have come a long way in the field of human rights in a way that we might not be able to list here ; we established institutions and mechanisms that preserve them in accordance with a comprehensive and integrated vision of these rights .
the countdown for war , as it seems and looks , has started . it is inevitable that our efforts , which have been directed until now into one direction , which is averting the war , must move in a new direction , which is saving our dear homeland and its dear citizens from its consequences and repercussions .
in order to protect this homeland , its holy sites , security and safety , your state has taken the following resolutions , which are resolutions i have no doubts - god willing - that reflect your initial positions , are in harmony with your commitment to the arab and islamic values , and have your unanimous approval .
first : the kingdom will not participate in any way whatsoever in the war on brotherly iraq and will not send its armed forces under any circumstance to go one span into the iraqi territories .
second : we expect the war to end with the implementation of security council resolution 1441 to remove weapons of mass destruction . we absolutely refuse any infringement of the unity of iraq , its independence , it wealth , its internal security , or that it is subjected to military occupation . we have informed the united states of our clear saudi position .
third : the exceptional circumstances that have surrounded this crisis for twelve years impose on us that we do not enter an uncalculated adventure that jeopardizes the safety of our homeland and our people .
in spite of that , it is incumbent upon us to say that if the events take a course other than the one we have explained , or if the war exceeds its declared goals , then we will have a different position . then , every event will have a different approach .
my country has had the honor to head the general assembly of the arab institution for satellite communications ( arabsat ) during the past year .
during this period , thanks to your insightful directives and the teaming up of all efforts at the institution , at the different levels , the institution achieved considerable profits that exceeded all expectations . they amounted to over 74 million dollars , an increase of 56% in comparison with the results of the year 2000 , which confirms the trust of those dealing with this institution and the correctness of its approach .
your attendance here , despite your many preoccupations , expresses in a clear way the special care your governments give to developing the sector of communications and their realization of the strategic role this sector plays in the economic and social development of our countries .
today , the development and modernizing of the communications sector is at the core of the interests of our states and governments because of their importance in reducing distances and strengthening the links between peoples and nations , facilitating the exchange of information , activating exchanges and services in all the essential fields , which brings great benefits to all cultural , economic and social activities to take advantage of the latest technological developments .
there is no doubt that arabsat , this pioneering arab organization , has played a vital role in bringing the people of the arab countries closer to one another and to the peoples of the other countries of the world through the many developed services it renders at all levels through its system of satellite channels .
the institution has taken several steps in the right direction .
allow me , ladies and gentlemen , to offer , in the name of my country , congratulations to the african committee on human and peoples ' rights for the proficient work it has undertaken in the interest of advancing and protecting human rights on our african continent .
the convening of the thirty first session gives me a good opportunity to confirm once again the adherence of the islamic republic of mauritania to islam and to the principles of democracy as defined by the universal declaration of human rights and the african convention of the human and peoples rights - these two documents that are considered to be the reference for the constitution of our country , which was endorsed through a popular referendum in july 1991 .
this constitution , from which emanated the state of law , has protected and enhanced basic freedoms , set pluralist democracy and guaranteed the independence of the judiciary , thus endowing human rights with a constitutional imprint . it stipulates that , the freedom and dignity of man , as well as his right to equality , cannot be guaranteed except in a society that believes in the precedence of right .
i am pleased in this regard to mention that since the publishing of the constitution , the public authorities have been working and concentrating their efforts in order to enhance the framework for the implementation of human rights through adapting and reviewing various laws that express explicitly and without vagueness the directives and personal commitment of the president of the republic , mr. moawiya wild sayyed ahmad al-taye , to the objective of improving the flow and performance of our democracy , integrating all the marginalized classes , advancing women , protecting children and involving the civil society in the effort to develop the country .
here , it is worthwhile to praise the reforms related to the administration , the judiciary , the educational system , the elections system , the funding of political parties , the civil situation , and the recent endorsement of the law that includes the civil status code , in view of the positive reflections of these reforms on improving human rights .
first of all , i would like to thank you for this warm welcome and joy with which you have received us , which is what we have been used to every time we visit this dear historical city .
the goal of this visit , as mentioned in the speech of the lord mayor , is to set the cornerstone for the reconstruction and expansion of the al ni'meh airport so that it becomes an international airport capable of receiving large planes , as well as to inaugurate the mobile telephone network in the city and open a tourist complex in it .
in a few days , the water project will be inaugurated . we are aware that the water network has now arrived at the city in large quantities that are in excess of the drinking needs and that allow their utilization in agriculture and in the establishment of factories and economic projects .
without electricity , water and the means of communication , there cannot be comprehensive economic development that has real value . these methods are now available in al ni'meh city , thanks be to god .
through this visit , we wanted to draw the attention of businessmen in ni'meh , as well as the productive cooperatives and the different national economic activists , that the time has come to invest inside the country , especially in ni'meh city .
first of all , i would like to thank you for this warm welcome and joy with which you have received us .
the welcome was wonderful and the joy was great , which is what we have been used to every time we visit this beautiful district of yours .
the goal of the visit is to communicate and talk with you about the national and local issues that concern you and to provide you with information on the distances that our developmental course has covered .
as you know , the general situation is relatively good .
at the economic level , economic performance is constantly improving and the rate of annual growth continues to rise , while inflation rates are declining . markets are brisk .
in general , the state is stronger economically , and there is nothing to worry about . on the contrary , all indications are promising and reducing our debt will make it possible to provide large amounts that will be spent to raise the living standard of citizens and provide basic social services .
it pleases me at the beginning of this speech to convey to you the greetings of the president of the mauritanian islamic republic , mr. moawiya weld sayyed ahmad al-taye , and his wishes for prosperity and success for the deliberations of this summit .
on this occasion , i present , on behalf of the president of the republic , warm congratulations to his highness sheikh hamad bin khalifah al thani for his valuable initiative and the good circumstances that have been provided to guarantee the success of this summit .
i would like to thank the authorities here in the brotherly state of qatar for the warm welcome , the generous hospitality and great care we have been accorded .
in this regard , i can only value the extensive efforts exerted by the secretary general of the organization of the islamic conference , mr. abdul wahid balqiziz , in the interest of our organization .
this emergency summit convenes at a circumstance that is characterized by the immensity of the challenges that face our nation and the great dangers that surround it , which require more cooperation and solidarity from all of us .
with regard to the iraqi crises , on which we are deliberating today in the framework of this summit , we must exert all possible effort to avoid the war that escalates the suffering of the brotherly iraqi people and exposes the region to great dangers , and work to find a peaceful solution based on commitment to international legitimacy and the implementation of security council resolutions .
we have seen , in less than one generation , the fastest progress of freedom in the story of democracy that spans two thousand and five hundred years .
historians in the future will offer their interpretations of the reasons that led to this , but we know now some of the reasons they will list .
it is not a coincidence that this large number of democracies has emerged at the same time during which the most powerful states were democratic themselves .
the united states made military and moral pledges in europe and asia that protected the free states from aggression and created the circumstances under which the new democracies could prosper .
with us providing security to entire states , we also provided inspiration to oppressed peoples in prison camps , in banned union meetings , and in clandestine churches .
men and women have known that the entire world does not share their nightmare with them .
i came to you today putting before you four self - evident truths in order to point out , through them , two rights :
the first truth , with which i start , is that the long night of iraq is over .
the bitter experience lived by the iraqis for over three decades of oppression , repression , tyranny , despotism and humiliation has ended with the fleeing of the head of the regime and his followers and the fall of the symbols he erected throughout baghdad and all over iraq .
as for the second truth , the liberation of iraq and what has happened is decidedly a liberation , which could not have taken place without the resolve of president bush , to which the coalition states , in the forefront of which are the united states and the united kingdom , committed themselves .
today , as we hear the voices of skeptics towards the intentions of the american and british governments in undertaking the liberation , we call on them only to visit the mass graves , to visit the dried ahwar and halabjeh , and to call to mind the lists of the missing people who were denied their right to live by the regime .
the third truth is that the liberation has come as an embodiment of a comprehensive national iraqi will , and has come as a result of the persevering work undertaken by the factions of the iraqi opposition to the defunct regime over the long years , during which they offered hundreds of thousands of martyrs , the last of whom has not been the martyr , ayatollah mohammad baqer al-hakim and his followers , may god have mercy on them all for they wrote another page in the record of iraqi heroism last august , the day of the iraqi martyr . nor has it been the woman martyr , aqeelah al-hashimi , who was assassinated by the hand of betrayal .
we have determined to change and develop and to take the initiative without hesitation , whatever the difficulties , so that the roots of jordan remain deeply - rooted and established in its surroundings and in the world . for jordan , in its hashemite message , is jordan the pioneer , jordan the example and the model .
the convening of your esteemed council today signifies the completion of the institutional building , which is in harmony with the constitution , and which emphasizes your legislative and vital role . through you , it also represents the aspirations of the sons and daughters of jordan and embodies their ambitions and the horizon for a prosperous tomorrow .
in the footsteps of our promise and our belief in the " jordan first " principle , your esteemed council represents the future of our sons and daughters and our children , in the desert , the countryside , and in the village , camp and city . therefore , we want it to be a legislative council that is distinguished in its performance and an authority to which our government has recourse in the course of setting its comprehensive plans and national programs to achieve the positive change and to meet the ambitions and hopes of our youth , from " jordan first " to jordan in the present and in the future .
our vision for the jordan of the future is based on a firm foundation . its stock is that jordan is a modern democratic country and an original part of its arab and islamic nation and that it takes pride in belonging to it and in its inveterate hashemiteness .
it is committed with complete assurance to highlighting this bright and genuine image of islam , in creed and practice , in order to spread " jordan " as a civilized example of tolerance , freedom of thought , creativity and excellence .
here you are - as evident in your speeches , which are redolent with the fragrance of jordan , of its north and south , its center and east , its ghor ( jordan valley ) , its highlands , and its desert - on the verge of exonerating your national conscience and casting your votes in a state of openness , whose equals are few and which involves choices that consecrate pluralism and freedom , amid the monitoring of our people and the blessing of our dearly beloved leader , the object on which expectations and hopes are pinned .
yes , you are on the verge of folding a page in order to start pages of cooperation , integration , monitoring , accountability and consultation .
no one is ignorant of the truth that we are in one boat , where we are united and different , agree and disagree with one another . it is our unique , ultimate and eternal homeland . and it is our unique , ultimate and eternal throne . and it is jordan until god inherits the earth and what is on it .
i am telling you sincerely that the reality is difficult , the burden is heavy , and the region is ebullient and constantly turning .
yet , all that will not make our knees tremble , and it will make our firm wills slacken because under the leadership of abu al-hussein , the carrier of the al-hussein 's scepter , glory and banners , we proceed to meet the destinies of the men who are born for confrontation and success .
over the past four years , you have experienced the determination of the leader and his will that is kneaded of steel , carved out of the stone of petra , the blade of mu'tah and the glorious achievement of yarmouk . you have seen that what has been accomplished during this short time was amazing and momentous .
praise be to god and prayers and peace be upon our patron , the messenger of god , as well as his family and companions . ladies and gentlemen , esteemed parliamentarians . by opening this parliamentary session , we are completing the renewal of the constitutional institutions , embodying our firm royal will to give the democratic course its straight path as an option from which there is no return , whatever the delicacy of the national and international challenges .
and if we are proud of the achievement of this qualitative transition , does this mean we have reached the perfection that we strive for ?
we have stressed repeatedly that there is no democracy without democrats and that democracy is a long and hard road and not an artificial field for the war of positions . nay , it is committed citizenship , practice that is unavoidable , for the good management of public concerns , especially the local one .
it cannot be fortified except with firmly establishing a culture of citizenship , entrusted to political parties and the institutions of the civic society , and with improving the living conditions of citizens , so that they can seen it in their daily reality .
whatever the structure of the elected councils may be , we will not stop posing the essential question : is election a goal in itself and the end of the road ?
no , because respecting the popular necessitates rejection of the mentality of the democracy of seats and commitment to the virtues of the democracy of development .
i am pleased to talk to you after the conclusion of the second national forum for intellectual dialogue , which convened recently in the environs of god 's sacred house in holy mecca , whose subject was " excessiveness and moderation : a comprehensive methodological vision " . this meeting has embodied the islamic and national spirit of brotherhood . the dialogue took place in an atmosphere of friendship and mutual respect .
the forum discussed several important studies , prepared by experienced specialists , dealing with excessiveness in all its aspects . the forum concluded with constructive recommendations that support national unity and enhance the values of dialogue , moderation and tolerance .
these recommendations will receive their worth in terms of state care .
i look forward to the convening of the coming forum in the vastness of the city of al-madina al-munawara , the city of our prophet and master mohammad , may god bless him and salute him with respect , to discuss two important issues : " education and women " .
in addition to the organized dialogue that takes place at the king abdul aziz center for national dialogue , these days the saudi society is witnessing a wide dialogue that includes categories of the society and is carried out through the various media .
dialogue , in principle , is a healthy , positive phenomenon , but we must be very careful that the blessing does not turn into a curse . any dialogue that is not committed to the methodology , rules and proper behavior of dialogue will turn into chaos that neither nourishes nor satisfies hunger and will be harmful , not beneficial .
as part of the ongoing deliberations at the international justice court regarding the legal status of the barrier wall established by israel in the occupied west bank , the kingdom gave its legal statement before the court with the beginning of deliberations . it confirmed through it the illegality of the barrier , and that it constitutes a blatant violation of the fourth geneva accord and all related international resolutions and conventions .
this barrier does not only constitute an isolation of the palestinians , it stands as an obstacle to all initiatives and peaceful resolutions presented to find a just resolution to the conflict , in a unilateral step that makes it difficult to reach any future settlement , in addition to imposing a new reality on the ground that could complicate the situation and add new burdens to the current essential issues in the palestinian israeli conflict .
with regard to iraq , the kingdom welcomes the results of the fifth neighboring countries conference recently held in kuwait , where iraq 's participation in the meeting for the first time gave it much importance and positiveness , and provided the opportunity to become familiar with the needs of iraq from its neighbors , and what iraq 's neighbors need from it .
there was reaffirmation on the unity of iraqi territories and the respect of its sovereignty and independence , and the right of the iraqi people to determine their fate and political future .
the neighboring countries confirmed their readiness to support all diplomatic and political efforts aimed at achieving the hoped for goals to enable iraq to practice its positive role as an effective member of the international community , and build positive relations with its neighbors characterized by goodwill , respect and peace according to the regulations of international law and commitment to international covenants .
the crystallization of a strong and practical partnership between us is justified by the facts of history and geography and the requirements of reason .
aside from the interests that affect free trade , economic globalization , and technological advancement , it too has made it incumbent upon us to increase communication and frank dialogue to be able to better understand each other .
especially in view of the challenges imposed on us by the grave events our two regions are going through , which have resulted in several mistaken concepts , assumptions and predisposed positions in the political , cultural and / or religious aspects , of which we must confront to avoid their negative impact on our future .
i am pleased to review with you today some proposals and visions , seeking to achieve this goal .
to begin with , i would like to reaffirm our entrenched belief that change and reform are considered an urgent need in the arabic world if we want our honest ambitions towards advancement and development to be achieved .
reform must come from within to guarantee the prosperity of citizens and respond to their aspirations for a prosperous society where the principles of justice and equality in rights and duties prevail .
human development and economic prosperity are the key to a better future for the middle east .
the european community and the arabic world can achieve great gains by reaching this goal .
any effort in this regard should support our cooperation towards achieving peace and prosperity in this turbulent part of the world .
it is of greatest importance to work towards putting an end to occupation and the cycle of violence , extremism and terrorism .
it is not possible to achieve this goal except through deeper understanding , good will , the adoption of fair policies and a commitment to implementing them .
it is incumbent upon us to prevent leaving the field open to this minority of terrorists and extremists to fill the minds of our youth with hate , spite and stereotypes .
of course , a group of states are arguing that the court must not offer any consultative opinion in this matter , as requested by the general assembly of the united nations .
the argument they present is simply the argument offered in other cases asking for a consultative opinion to imply that the case is ambiguous or that the court will be in danger of a predisposed verdict on the negotiations or being far from its judicial role .
such arguments failed in the past before this court .
at the same time , it is to be observed that one finds that these same states advocate the alternative opinion . they believe that the court must not give an opinion , but they go ahead to stress their position vis - à - vis the essence of the subject at the time when the court embarks on giving the opinion .
this is not the issue here .
for example , in the case of weapons of mass destruction , seven states argued in written statements that the court must not give its opinion .
i am also pleased to commend the distinguished presence of senior officials of the european union , which contributes to the launching of the first serious and practical step in the field of processing hard waste , which include all lebanese regions ( municipalities and villages ) in order to enhance balanced and fair development as part of the arla program .
the experience of municipal work in lebanon is not new . the civil society has known it and has familiarized itself with its problems and is seeking to develop it and expand the range of its services , cooperating with the concerned administrations and the supportive bodies , whether they are local or international .
the lebanese government , especially the ministry of the interior and municipalities , has taken notice of the importance of the work of municipalities as local authorities managing a public affair , with which the civil society has been distinguished , meeting the requirements of this society , facilitating the affairs of citizens and maintaining public health , which is considered an urgent need due to the imbalance in the environment as a result of industrial development . if we do not hasten to tackle the problem of waste , we will face an environmental disaster .
hence , the importance of cooperation among the local administrations across the borders , because science , knowledge and development do not know geographic borders . they are the property of the all humanity .
due to the current vast cooperation between the officials in the european union and the lebanese government , we have really come to the stage of finding solutions , now that financial support has been made available and the raising of problems and their reflections has been overstepped into the stage of study and implementation . this is considered to be a national responsibility that falls on the shoulders of everyone , without exception , and to the custody of bodies elected by the people , which shoulder their full responsibilities , after the law has given them the authority that enables them to achieve developmental goals that contribute to removing the danger of pollution , which spares no one .
i am pleased to meet with the head of the commission of the european union in lebanon , my friend ambassador patrick renault , to sign the protocol of the agreement on funding projects for the treatment of solid waste in the municipalities , funded by the arla program with a grant by the european union .
the agreement 's protocol includes the creation of an independent account in the value of 10.2 million euros , allocated to fund projects submitted by the municipalities to treat solid waste , under the management of the minister of administrative development and the monitoring of the european union commission .
the signing of this protocol will make it possible to secure real support for municipalities through finding the funding for one of the most important problems they face , which is the treatment of solid waste , about which many officials in municipal councils have declared their desire to address as a top priority .
this support is provided to all the municipalities in lebanon , without exception , whether they are municipal unions , or a group of municipalities , or villages that have no municipalities . they can all benefit from this project just by submitting the appropriate files .
these files are subject to scrutiny and selection by a committee that includes representatives of the ministry of the interior and municipalities , ministry of the environment , and the development and reconstruction council .
the agreement protocol perceives the creation of a specialized unit at the ministry of administrative development , equipped with the qualified technical and administrative element , for the management of this project .
it has become known that modern development has three pillars : the state , the private sector and the civil society .
in as much as the abilities of the state and the private sector are great , the abilities of the civil society are weak .
but there is no balanced , just and sustainable development without the development of the civil society .
based on this theory , the european union , on an initiative from its ambassador in lebanon , friend patrick renault , has decided to support the lebanese civil society through offering a one million euro grant allocated to projects undertaken by various kinds of non - governmental lebanese organizations , the different trade unions and federations , and all the non - profit cooperatives .
the value of funding for each project ranges between 25 thousand and 50 thousand euros .
the financial value of this support is not the most important .
i say this because , as part of our follow - up on archeological sites , discoveries and archeological buildings , we face the problem of transgression and protection for transgressors in a number of areas under different headings . consequently , there is tampering with archeological buildings and regions , as well as transgressions in archeological sites classified by unesco , and this classification is threatened due to these transgressions .
naturally , no one amongst us in lebanon dares to do anything if protection is not provided to them . if this is done by chance or because of greed without prior protection , then consequent protection is provided because we are not able to hold anyone accountable and to make any decisions against anyone .
we , at the ministry of culture , with this code or without it , have been sending more than one letter over the period of consecutive weeks about violations in certain areas . none of these reminders , letters , and correspondences have been implemented and the reasons are always political interventions in the regions , ministers , personalities , activities and social status .
it is only an attempt at drawing benefits by someone or another . if the situation continues as it is , it is in vain that we try to enact a citizen 's law or a heritage law in the general sense of the word .
good governance is an old dream that enticed the greeks with plato 's " republic " attracted the arabs with al-farabi in " the superior city " and preoccupied western thought through the writings of hobbes , montesquieu , hegel and marx .
before good governance , islam knew the experience of " worthy ancestors " .
the term governance in the arab language came to mean not only the management of public affairs , as is the case in other languages , but to include the concepts of justice , knowledge and wisdom , which prevailed under the " worthy ancestors " .
the arab dream of good governance collides with numerous external and internal challenges .
in the forefront of the external challenges we mention israel 's occupation of the arab territories and its continued aggression on the arabs , militarily , information - wise , economically and culturally , thus hindering the progress of security , peace and development in the middle east , in addition to the absence of arab solidarity in confronting occupation , aggression , globalization and cut - throat economic competition .
at the head of internal challenges , we point to arab incapability in the field of freedoms , democracy , human rights and equality between men and women , in addition to the prevalence of the curse of poverty , disease , deprivation , unemployment , pollution and information illiteracy .
the male and female trainees , to whom we are distributing certificates today , embody two inseparable principles that occupy the priorities ladder of any public administration , namely : human resources development and serving the citizen .
the ministry of administrative development has been working , since its establishment , on two courses linked to these two principles : the course of training in human resources development in the administrative and technological fields , in addition to training components in private projects , including project plans for the improvement of performance , and the course of providing quality service to the citizen with savings in cost and time through disseminating a new administrative culture and through mechanisms for simplifying procedures .
i am pleased today to share with the ministry of finance , specifically the property tax department , in distributing certificates to 68 controllers from all governorates , who have been trained for ten weeks at a cost amounting to about 30 thousand euros , funded from the european union grant within the arla project .
at the outset , i thank the european union in the personage of our friend , ambassador patrick renault .
i also thank the financial institute for hosting us and the master plan company for its good implementation of the training .
i also thank the joint work team of the ministries of finance and administrative development for the efforts they made to make the training process successful .
at the outset , i would like to thank his excellency the minister and friend , mr. fouad al sa'ad , for launching the " citizen 's code " project , and his excellency minister karim baqardoni for following up that initiative , as well as all the work team , who have attained a preliminary draft of the citizen 's code related to public funds .
the law in its agreed - upon concept , is a text that sets specific visions and identifies commitments , which those concerned must follow in order to realize those visions , so that the code consequently becomes the moral foundation for that vision and an instrument for achieving it .
in the financial subject , i hasten , at the beginning , to remind that since the emergence of the nucleus of what we now indicate as an institution under the name of the state , funds have been its nerve . consequently , taxes and duties have been the main source of the funds the state needs to carry on its affairs and to achieve and implement the services , which are expected and demanded by the citizens from the state .
therefore , taxes and duties were closely connected to all the patterns of states without exception .
hence , there emerged what is referred to as public funds , which is the subject of the draft code we are just discussing .
taxes and duties , which constitute the largest part of the sources of public funds , are collected in the name of the citizen and are supposed to be spent in the interest of the citizen as well .
our brother country lebanon has accustomed us that it is a forum for renewable thought , education , culture and sciences . and here we are today witnessing the opening of one of the important international forums to review and discuss the latest modern technical inventions and tools that the industry of education and training has been endowed with , after having witnessed last week , also in this place , an arab intellectual forum on teaching and education .
there is no doubt that the issues of education and human resources development are considered , more than at any other time , the important factors in the development of countries , the enhancement of their scientific presence and reaffirming their genuine independence in the shadow of severe competitive circles our world is living today .
i will present , in this intervention of mine , some of the inevitable future issues that have arisen in the form of challenges faced by higher education systems in the arab world , taking into consideration the influential forces at the international arena , which have originally contributed to the crystallization of these future issues and challenges i will talk about .
the first of these powers is the increased demand for higher education :
as you all know , the acceleration of economic , scientific and technological variables and the information explosion have imposed an increased demand for higher education and an unprecedented great interest in it . that was because the world has gone through a phase of great transformations that led to the creation of a new society called the information society , which has resulted in a knowledge economy , whose essence is what has been called the knowledge workers .
welcome to the forum on informatics in the development of the administration of municipalities ( electronic municipalities ) that will start in a short while with the participation of arab and foreign personalities and from canada , finland , jordan , muscat , and lebanon .
the most important themes that will be discussed in the forum are :
the first theme : " definition of electronic municipalities . "
the second theme : " the legal legislative aspect and electronic financial transactions . "
the third theme : " the transformation from manual work to electronic work . "
the fourth theme : " practical presentation of the mechanism for the work of the electronic municipality . "
we renew the pledge to our hero martyrs . we also renew the pledge to our brave prisoners in israeli prisons . we tell them we are committed to the pledge and that their case is at the top of the priorities of the palestinian authority and the fateh movement . we tell them that the dawn is coming soon , god willing .
on this occasion , we say that our people are being subjected to the most vicious attack witnessed by a people throughout history . it is a tyrannical aggression with the most developed kinds of weapons . it is a magnificent steadfastness by this people that tells the whole world that we are a people holding on to our rights and that we must have a place under the sun that is appropriate to it , to its struggle and to its sacrifices .
the faithful cadres of fateh and its men and heroes always were deserving of the responsibility placed on their shoulder . they were always renewing the blood , renewing the resolve and the determination to continue in the path of their leaders , who died on the road , or those who are still potential martyrs . the cadres of fateh and its heroes are still committed to the pledge .
we always trust that the fateh movement is continuously capable of renewing its blood , of giving , of establishing justice and equality among its cadres , and of spreading a democratic environment in its ranks . it is , god willing , at the gates of a new phase after this magnificent steadfastness and brave struggle waged by the masses of our people under the leadership of the fateh movement .
we tell our cadres to trust that the fateh movement is your movement , it is a movement of giving , it is a movement of strugglers . it is not the movement of those who came before , but that of those who were true .
as for this tragic and bitter reality , suffered and lived by our people daily , we urge you loved ones , each through his position , work and relations , in an individual and collective manner , to deliver the just voice of your people and its just cause , as well as the war , terrorism , aggression , violations and bloody invasions it is subjected to at the hands of occupation army troops and the settlers , who continue to plunder and steal , and even annex our lands and to establish more colonialist settlement posts and to expand and fatten those already standing .
the israeli talk of evacuating some of the settlement positions is only meant to throw dust in the eyes ( blur the vision of ) and to mislead the international public opinion .
all that takes places at an organized pace , with the aim of legitimizing and consecrating their occupation of our land and holy sites , and depriving our people of embodying its sacred right to return , self - determination and the establishment of its palestinian state with jerusalem as its capital , by transforming our territories into isolated " cantons " deprived of communication among them .
it is a far worse situation that the system of " apartheid , " which was implemented in south africa , not to forget the military and colonialist barriers on the streets , roads and mountain tops , as well as the entrances of every village , town and camp , whose number has exceeded 750 checkpoints .
for you , to you , to the brotherly lebanese people and to his excellency president emil lahoud , all the greeting , all the respect and all the love .
as you go out today on this popular march , which includes all the lebanese parties and all the sons of the brotherly people of lebanon , to declare in your name , in the name of brotherly lebanon , in the name of all the arab brethren , and in the name of all the free and honorable people in the entire world , that the proud and grand brotherly people of lebanon stand by their brothers , the palestinian people , in their just struggle in opposition to , in opposition to settlements , in opposition to the wicked military escalation , in opposition to the daily crimes committed against our children , women and people , and against our infrastructure and our institutions , and in opposing the racist wall of annexation and expansion .
and in order for the palestinian people to be triumphant in winning its freedom , independence and sovereignty in its independent palestinian state with jerusalem as its capital , god willing , and for sake of the right of palestinian refugees to return to their homeland , lands and homes , from which they were driven away by force and aggression , and in order to defend our christian and muslim holy sites , and also to secure the release of the heroic prisoners and detainees .
from here , from the heart of the siege imposed on our palestinian people and its legitimate leadership , i tell you - dear lebanese brothers - thank you from the heart and conscience .
on this historic day , the palestinian people , and with it all the honorable people in the world , looks forward to hearing the word of international law , the word of human justice and the word of international legitimacy , as the international court of justice convenes at the hague on the basis of the resolution of the general assembly of the united nations asking it to give its opinion on the issue of constructing the wall of annexation , expansion and racial segregation , which the government of israel is building on our palestinian land .
the pinnacle of this tragedy comes with the building of this expansionist , occupationist , colonialist and racist wall , which has transformed our cities , villages and refugee camps into prisons and encampments for collective detention . with what right are our people denied their land and imprisoned in these ghettos , which the government of israel is establishing ?
at the same time , its occupying army with the settlers exercise all forms of terrorism , aggression and killing against our people and land ; destroy our entire infrastructure ; bulldoze our agricultural land , farmlands and homes ; confiscate our underground water , and withhold our tax and customs funds for more than three years so far !
here is our people , the people of the giants , standing patiently and steadfastly , in spite of these daily crimes , which are perpetrated against it by the israeli occupation army , its tanks , artillery , missiles and planes , as well as its internationally - banned weapons and these inhuman and tragic circumstances that no other people in the entire world has lived through .
in fact , the peace process has entered a dark and long tunnel after that ; but , we have maintained our correct vision of peace to serve our palestinian people , our arab nation and the entire region on the basis of the saudi initiative adopted by the arab summit in beirut .
peace is a sure benefit for the palestinian people , just as security and peace are a sure benefit for the israeli people , especially for the forces of peace . of the people of moses , there is a nation , who guide by doing justice in the light of truth . you saw how , at the hague , in jerusalem too and elsewhere , rabbis and peace forces stood and marched side by side with you against what is happening against the palestinian people .
our political position arises from the interest of our people and from a deep realization of the facts and variables that in turn affect our palestinian situation , our arab situation and the situation of the entire arab world , and the peace process in the entire region .
from here , we have held on . we declare today , before our revolutionary council , that the fateh movement is holding on to the option of the just , lasting and comprehensive peace , to the negotiations and to all international legitimacy resolutions , the last of which is the road map that represents today the international legitimacy , with its various effective forces , as approved in accordance with the russian initiative now at the international security council .
the steadfast , garrisoned palestinian people are today commemorating and celebrating " international women 's day " on the eighth of march , to confirm with strong entrenched conviction and belief that the palestinian society rejects all forms of discrimination against women .
the only discrimination approved by our people is the positive discrimination in favor of women and their full participation and empowerment in performing their genuine role in making the national future , side by side with men and on equal footing in rights , duties and opportunities . that is what has been confirmed by the palestinian declaration of independence document . the palestinian woman is the protector of our survival and the guard of our permanent fire .
the palestinian woman has forged her way in complete equality in the right to education and the right to work in all walks of life , as well as in the paths of freedom and the arenas of struggle , relentlessness and steadfastness for our people since the early years of the twentieth century and in confrontation of " sykes - picot " .
women participate effectively in public life , in associations , unions and societies , and in the various forms of combative , political , cultural , educational , economic and social activities , and in the decision - making process at the national level , whether at the " palestinian national council " or the " central " or the " legislative council , " and in the executive leadership frameworks in the " executive committee " and the " cabinet , " as there is a special ministry for the affairs of palestinian women .
this in turn is an indicator of the recognition and admission by the society of the effective role of women in making the national decision , of giving the cause of women all the interest it deserves , and of lifting any form of discrimination against them , in full cooperation with the " general union of palestinian women " and all the different women 's frameworks and formations .
i appeal to all lovers of democracy in the world to help our people inculcate and renew its democratic life , away from occupation , barriers , the annexation wall , expansion and racial separation . we stress here that palestinian democracy and the independent state of palestine , with jerusalem as its capital , are the genuine guarantee for security , peace and good neighborliness between them and us and in the entire region .
however , the continuation of the israeli occupation , the persecution , killing , destruction , repression , building settlements , the siege , and barriers , as well as transforming our land and cities into detention camps , will not build bridges of trust and will not provide the favorable soil for the establishment or genuine security and peace .
good neighborliness between the two peoples will not be achieved by building the annexationist , expansionist and separatist wall , which swallows , according to their maps , 58% of our palestinian land and transforms holy jerusalem , the capital of palestine , and its christian and islamic holy shrines into a ghetto , surrounded by the wall and by barbed and electronic wires , where palestinians are prohibited from entering into their holy city of noble jerusalem and praying in the aqsa mosque and the church of the holy sepulcher , and where the historical and religious road is blocked in their faces between noble jerusalem and bethlehem and the nativity church of our lord the messiah , peace be upon him .
also , what is happening in hebron and the ibrahimi mosque there , what is happening in nablus and its historic old city shows that they do not even respect their own history . our lord yousef and his father lived there before going to egypt . from jeningrad ( jenin after lenengrad ) to rafahgrad ( rafah , after lenengrad ) , throughout the west bank and the entire gaza strip , there is military escalation , destruction , assassinations and detentions according to their military plan called ( the game of the outside ) , which they have officially announced and which started with the massacre at bureig and nusseirat and yesterday in jenin . no one knows what will happen today and tomorrow , it is them and us and the time is long .
dear brethren : what happened in the kingdom recently , including bombings in riyadh and the capturing of wanted persons in al-madinah al-munawarrah and makkah al-mukarrmah and elsewhere , are matters that require questioning , thought , and a search into the causes of why such actions happen and what are the components of their motives ?
how can there be thought and attitudes that do not agree at all with the reality of a homeland that has chosen god 's decree as the arbitrator in its methodology and selected god 's book and the teachings of his prophet , may god 's prayer and peace be upon him , as a constitution that governs words and deeds .
were the criminal acts we witnessed perpetrated by young citizens who targeted people with killing , properties with sabotage , and families with horror ?
was the source of all that a thought that arose from this land , or was it an imported thought , or the product of the beguilement of a group whose minds had not yet matured ? or , could that be attributed to several causes , with numerous parties , both at home and abroad ? also , what was the strength and prevalence of this thought ?
these questions , dear brethren , and others are what must be researched to find answers to them when looking at the problem of those who opposed the nation in its correct methodology and chose the ways of the devil , and deviated from right .
the problem , in my opinion or vision , does not lie in a criminal act perpetrated by a criminal as a result of criminal desires or tendencies . it is rather bigger than that . it is a problem of convictions . if the wrong is committed on the basis of conviction in its correctness , we must look into the roots ; the roots of the formation of convictions , the building of beliefs and the formulation of attitudes .
as we open the works of the eighth legislative session of your esteemed council , i cannot but convey to you my heartfelt congratulations for the precious trust , which the citizens have accorded to you , from their different social strata , so that you become genuine representatives of them , true to their interests and the interest of the homeland , its future and destiny .
i am also pleased to congratulate you on the fortieth anniversary of the glorious revolution of the eighth of march , from which arose the blessed reform movement that promised and delivered . the first people 's council convened for the first time thirty two years ago , and the legislative sessions followed in succession in an organized manner , practically embodying the democracy that arose from our heritage and is appropriate to our circumstances .
the last seven sessions accomplished great work in the field of legislation and monitoring and adopted many laws through which we achieved a great renaissance on all fronts .
regardless of any academic or scientific definition of the meaning of the revolution , such as the radical change of something , or the complete transformation in the course of history , the actual revolution , to me , is the continuous reality that follows the radical change , which is a continuous state of development and progress towards the best .
the industrial revolution , for example , was not limited to one day , days or a few years .
the same applies to the digital revolution , which emerged in the eighties and is still continuing until this day with great momentum .
the celebration of a specific day is a symbol of this change , but development and progress are a continuation of that day .
madam president , we welcome you warmly to preside over this session .
this interest reflects your personal concern and the concern of your friendly country , chile , in confronting the major challenges that confront the generations of the future and in putting an end to them .
so you are greatly welcome .
we would like to thank the executive director of the united nations children 's fund , carol bellamy , and the special representative of the secretary general , otono olara , for their valuable statements at the beginning of this session .
we confirm to you that what came in them contributes to going ahead with confronting the challenge represented in the problem of children suffering during armed conflicts .
my delegation read the report of the secretary general presented before us and we believe that it enjoys the interest of all of us .
at the beginning , madam president , i would like to express the appreciation of egypt 's delegation of yourself and of your friendly country for presiding over this important session . i would also like to thank the secretary general and his special representative , mr. olara otono , for their efforts and valuable contributions to the enhancement and protection of children 's rights during armed conflicts .
i would also like to commend the efforts of mrs. carol bellamy , the executive director of the united nations children 's fund ( unicef ) , in the field of enhancing and protecting children 's rights , and to confirm the complete commitment of my country to supporting all efforts exerted in this regard .
since many years , the council has been showing special interest in the issue of refugee and internally displaced children , who were forced to flee their homes , as well as children who were recruited and sexually abused , with special attention given to girls because they are more at risk of confronting additional dangers , especially sexual violence .
it is a commendable effort by the council , which my country supports and hopes that it will continue .
but , here i would like to draw the attention of the esteemed council to a group of children who were forgotten . they are the children under foreign occupation , especially the children in the occupied palestinian territories , who are dying daily as a result of the continuous violations of their human rights and the excessive use of violence .
it is enough to take a quick look at the number of children , who fall victim as a result of the ongoing conflict , to realize the importance of addressing this subject and highlighting it .
allow me to turn to you with thanks for convening this open session and for providing member states once again with the opportunity to present their opinion and express their concerns with regard to the subject of addressing the question of unlawful trafficking in small weapons and light weapons .
i also turn with thanks to the secretary general for the report submitted in this regard .
nor should i fail to turn with thanks and appreciation to mr. apier , the deputy secretary general for disarmament affairs , for his presentation of the secretary general 's report .
the 2001 united nations conference stressed that the problem of the unlawful trafficking in small and light weapons is a complicated and greatly - difficult matter in view of threat it poses to the lives of the innocent , especially children , women and the elderly , who have been victims of these weapons . this is the matter for which we have called upon all states , especially those that manufacture and export these weapons , to exert all the possible efforts , and through international cooperation , to put an end to , and find useful solutions for this tragedy .
the disastrous effects of the question of small and light weapons have been depicted in the conflicts that some states in the african continent have witnessed and are still witnessing , as well as other regions that witness similar conflicts .
on this occasion , we reiterate our demand from all states to respect the bans imposed by security council resolutions on the exportation of small weapons and light weapons to the african states that witness armed conflicts .
it pleases me to welcome amongst us in this meeting mr. jose ramos huerta , the foreign minister of timor - lishti .
we wish him , his government and his people all the success in building their emerging country .
it also pleases me to express our thanks to the united nations secretary general , mr. kofi annan , for his special report on the united nations mission for support in timor - lishti and also to mr. jean - marie kamaleesh - sharma , the secretary general 's personal representative in timor lishti , who deserves all appreciation .
the secretary general 's special report reviews in a comprehensive manner all the important developments witnessed by timor lishti since its independence , as well as the accomplishments that have been achieved in the area of reconstruction and the challenges that are still looming there .
allow us also to confirm the validity of what was said in many of the statements delivered , which pointed out that timor - lishti is one of the united nations ' success stories as a result of the thorough follow - up , which came about as a result of the efforts of the general assembly and its special committee on the liquidation of colonialism , or to the work undertaken by the security council , and the efforts exerted by the united nations general secretariat .
the delegation of syria supports what was mentioned in the report that the political institutions in timor - lishti have continued in development and that the progress achieved evokes admiration .
thank you , mr. president , for holding this session .
we congratulate you on your assumption of the presidency of the council for this month and wish you all the success .
we thank the chilean delegation for its successful leadership of the council 's work during the last month .
my delegation also thanks the secretary general for his transitional report on the implementation of the recommendations , prepared by the security council mission dispatched to central africa , in which my delegation had the honor of participating .
the report , put before the council , proves the importance of the missions dispatched by the council to conflict areas , whose importance increases when coupled later with thorough work on the implementation of the recommendations that have been achieved .
my delegation feels satisfied with the accomplishment of a great part of the recommendations , made by the mission that visited central africa during the period from june 7 - 16 , 2003 .
in particular , those related to the establishment of interim institutions in the congo democratic republic in many important and sensitive areas , especially the naming of members of the interim government from the eight parties and entities that participated in the dialogue among the congolese sides , and the adoption by the council of ministers of a comprehensive set of general political objectives , including the formation of an integrated national army and an integrated national police force .
the secretary general 's transitional report on the progress achieved in implementing the recommendations of the security council mission dispatched to central africa surely reflects a fact , which the delegation of egypt would like to highlight before the security council , namely : while there are pieces of evidence that the situations in each of the democratic republic of the congo and burundi have moved in a positive direction , the challenges that face the re - establishment of peace , in its overall sense , for each of these two countries and for the great lakes area in general , are still enormous .
the exerting of efforts must be continued in order to counteract them .
in this context , our delegation would like to point out the following remarks :
first , it is of greatest importance to admit that tackling the post - conflict phase in the central africa region requires " partnership " between the interim governments , the united nations , the concerned regional and international powers , the african union , the sub - regional organizations and the international donors community .
that " partnership " must rely on the principle of " the integration and balance of responsibilities " among the partners .
we now have a clearer vision of the needs and requirements of the stages of making , safeguarding and building peace in the region , which are needs and requirements that extend beyond the limited security concept of peace into a wider list of interrelated and interlocked political , humanitarian , economic , and social factors , which necessitate the creation of an integrated package of assistance , incentives and pressures , which may be difficult to translate into a practical reality without the achievement of that required " partnership " .
the subject of " national reconciliation in the post - armed conflict stage " gains evident significance in the framework of addressing the future of the united nations ' role in the areas of making , keeping and building peace .
the centrality of the national reconciliation element cannot be diminished in the rehabilitation of societies that have suffered from the bitterness of armed conflicts and their reflections on the social fabric and the economic structure of the concerned states and regions , enabling them to turn the page on the past and to look forward to a future of peaceful co - existence , cooperation and the feeling of the unity of goals and interests .
in our estimation any talk about the role of the united nations in the national reconciliation processes should take into consideration a number of issues and elements in the following manner :
first , national reconciliation processes are long range processes , the main part of which enters into the framework of the concept of " peace building " , despite the fact that the process of laying down institutional structures for its management starts at an early time in the " peacekeeping " stage .
while the features of the direct role of the united nations in the area of peacekeeping have started to crystallize , according to the report by the " al-ibrahimi committee " , the organization 's role in the area of peacebuilding still needs more definition and rationalization so that it becomes possible to learn about the practical frame for united nations contributions in the area of national reconciliation .
secondly , the requirements and components of national reconciliation processes vary in accordance with the nature of the conflict under study , as well as the historical , cultural , social , political and economic dimensions relevant to the eruption of this conflict .
mr. president , we thank you for convening this meeting to look into the secretary general 's transitional report on the progress achieved in the implementation of the recommendations of the security council mission dispatched to west africa , in which syria has the honor of participating .
we also express our appreciation of the assistant secretary general , mr. kalomoh , for his presentation of the secretary general 's transitional report , in which he deals with the steps taken , or those which are intended to be taken , in the implementation of the recommendations of the security council mission to guinea - bissau , the côte d'ivoire , liberia , and sierra leone .
our delegation feels satisfied with the return of calm to guinea - bissau and with the pledge by the interim president and interim government to conduct legislative elections within the period stipulated in the interim charter , or before that time , in accordance with the recommendation of the national electoral committee .
we add our voice to the voice of the secretary general that the need for the participation of the international community is urgent , in order to provide the financial and other support to enable the local authorities to implement their commitments .
as for the côte d'ivoire , we agree with the secretary general that the linas - marcousi agreements must be implemented as soon as possible by all the parties in accordance with the recommendations of the council 's mission dispatched to the region , in addition to its recommendation in paragraph 31 of its report .
our delegation expresses its satisfaction that president gabagbu , prime minister diara and the new forces are implementing these recommendations in a transitional and consecutive manner .
i promise to adhere to the five minutes allocated to each speaker , even if it is necessary to stop delivering the written text of my statement .
mr. president , i would like to talk about numerous points as an egyptian commentary on the transitional report submitted by the secretary general on the progress being achieved in implementing the recommendations of the security council mission dispatched to west africa .
firstly , the interest in supporting cooperation and the raising of the capacities of the economic group for the states of west africa come as cornerstones in sub - regional dealings with the security and peace issue in this region .
undoubtedly , the group has provided a model that deserves appreciation of the african self - capacities in the areas of making and keeping peace during the last years , starting with sierra leone , passing through guinea - bissau and the côte d'ivoire , and ending with liberia .
that , in spite of the limited technical and marketing capacities made available to them .
we agree with the report in terms of the need to find an effective formula to help the group in overcoming the obstacles it faces in the direction of maintaining its distinguished performance in preventing the eruption of armed conflicts , settling such conflicts and in peacekeeping .
i would like to submit many thanks to all the delegations who supported this draft resolution , which is concerned with providing assistance to the palestinian people , and which was adopted a short while ago with a more than overwhelming majority .
we would also like to express our thanks to the states that adopted and submitted this important draft to the general assembly .
i would also like to express our appreciation and gratitude in this area to all the donor states and to the united nations agencies , regional commissions and non - governmental organizations , which generously provided humanitarian and other assistance to the palestinian people in the occupied palestinian land , including east jerusalem .
our people , who live under extremely difficult circumstances that are close to being a humanitarian disaster , feel greatly grateful to all of these .
at the same time , it goes without saying that most of the assistance comes basically as humanitarian aid , rather than economic development assistance , which is primarily caused by the terrible conditions created by the occupation force for the palestinian people .
consequently , the urgent matter is changing these circumstances in such a way that allows for a real economic development process .
allow me to make some of our remarks with regard to the issue put before us today .
firstly , the efficiency and credibility of the security council do not arise only from it being the mechanism that the world has accepted for more than half a century for keeping international peace and security , but also from its involvement in confronting the new challenges to peace and security at the regional and international levels , as well as its interaction with them and its development in confronting them .
from here , the realization by the council of the danger of trafficking in , and the unlawful spread of small and light weapons and their humanitarian reflections during the last years , makes it incumbent upon the council to move with the seriousness and efficiency that are commensurate to the enormity of the danger emanating from it , in order to confront this challenge .
secondly , the interaction between the security council and the general assembly is indispensable in addressing issues related to the unlawful spread of small and light weapons and in formulating and implementing an effective , long - range strategy for confronting them .
in this regard , the general assembly has made commendable progress by recommending at the end of december 2003 , the formation of an active work team with open membership , to study and formulate an international document to mark and monitor unlawful small and light weapons .
we hope that the work of this team will be crowned during the years 2004 - 2005 , with the aspired - for success , in order to consolidate international cooperation to prevent and put an end to the unlawful trafficking of small and light weapons .
mr. president : we have been keen on participating in today 's session in view of our belief in the significance of the continuous dialogue currently taking place within the different frames of the united nations about the threats represented by international terrorism to the walks of life of the international community , including its peace , security , development , and economic and social progress , requiring the collaboration of the wills of all the states in confronting it and guaranteeing wide - ranging international participation in combatting all the aspects of this danger .
allow me to present the following points , which we view as basic in our discussion today .
firstly , the question of terrorism has imposed itself strongly on the agenda of the united nations as an international threat that does differentiate or distinguish between countries , peoples , religions or cultures .
egypt was , and still is , in the vanguard of states that have emphasized the fact that that terrorism is an international phenomenon and , consequently , that confronting it necessitates a balanced , collective movement that evades unilateral measures and the enmity of cultures , civilizations or religions .
secondly , the anti - terrorism committee has , for the last two years , succeeded in re - emphasizing that the united nations , with its different organs , has the ability to confront , decisively and efficiently , the growing international threats .
from this point of departure , egypt has set a precedent in cooperating with the committee and providing it with reports , which now total three reports .
