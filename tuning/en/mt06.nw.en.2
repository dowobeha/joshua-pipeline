roed larsen : the middle east : " barrel of gunpowder with a burning wick "
oslo 2/06 ( a. f. p ) - the former u.n. envoy to the middle east , terje roed larsen , believes that the situation in this region has never been as dangerous as it is now , comparing the region to " a barrel of gunpowder with a burning wick . "
in an interview with norwegian state broadcasting ( nrk ) , roed larsen said , " the region now can be compared , in many aspects , to a barrel of gunpowder with a burning wick " .
he added , " i believe the situation is more difficult , complex , and dangerous than it has been in many decades . "
among the current and latent crises in the middle east , roed larsen mentioned the arab - israeli conflict , the iranian nuclear issue , and the crisis between lebanon and syria .
he said that " all this brings us back to questions of fundamental values and opinions that put the situation at risk of getting out of control at any moment more than it has been in recent days . "
roed larsen did not explicitly mention the violence that pervaded the demonstrations in the islamic world in protest against the publication of cartoons about the prophet muhammad in the european newspapers . he just stressed the necessity of " dialogue " instead of " throwing stones and setting fires . "
demonstrators set the danish and norwegian embassies in damascus on fire saturday , and a building containing an office of the danish embassy in beirut was also set on fire in response to the publication of the drawings in september in the danish newspaper jyllands - posten , and their subsequent republication in a number of european media , foremost among them the norwegian magazine magazinet .
roed larsen is currently assigned to monitor the implementation of security council resolution 1559 which calls for the disarming of the militias and armed groups in lebanon , including , according to the international organization , the shiite lebanese hezbollah , and palestinian groups .

a belgian mayor bans display of an artwork depicting saddam hussein .
brussels 2-7 ( afp ) - in a statement to the french press agency , the mayor of the western belgian town of middelkerke , michel landuyt , announced that he had decided to ban the display of a controversial artwork by the avant - garde czech artist david cerny , depicting the toppled iraqi president saddam hussein shackled , deeming it as " shocking . "
justifying his decision , landuyt , mayor of the small belgian coastal resort said on monday , " this artwork can shock people , not only from around here , but tourists as well , and potentially people of other faiths , especially muslims . "
he explained that the artwork was completed almost a year ago and " it had nothing to do with the issue of the prophet muhammad cartoons which were published in europe and had recently escalated into a wave of violence and protests in the islamic world .
the artwork called " the shark " depicts saddam hussein shackled and floating in a tank filled with liquid .
it was to be displayed during the beaufort 2006 arts festival .
michel landuyt said , " i considered ( the work ) too shocking , " stressing that saddam hussein is currently on trial and the hearings are aired on television .
" the shark " was first shown at the biennial " prague 2 " international exhibition which was held between may and september of 2005 .
david cerny ( 38 years old ) is known for his provocative work , which includes " the walking trabant " commemorating east germans who fled to the west in 1989 .

cairo 2-7 ( afp ) - the leader of the islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) parliamentary bloc , ismail haniyeh , announced that the movement , which won the legislative elections at the end of january , will officially ask the fatah movement , led by mahmoud abbas , to join the new government .
" we will sit down with them ( fatah movement ) and we will officially invite them to take part in this government , " said haniyeh , after a meeting monday evening with the chief of egyptian intelligence , general omar suleiman .
" we will wait for the official response from the fatah leadership , " he was quoted as saying by the official egyptian middle east news agency .
a number of fatah leaders have voiced opposition to joining the government that presumably will be formed by hamas , but no official decision has yet been issued by fatah on this matter .
" we assured omar suleiman that hamas is interested in consulting with all palestinian political parties . we discussed the international pressure and the threats to cut off aid to the palestinian people , " said haniyeh .
he added , " we emphasized that all these positions are unfair to our people but that we have alternative palestinian , arab , and islamic resources . "
he continued , " we also discussed the means to activate the palestinian liberation organization , given that the legislative elections were the first step , which will be followed by the next step dealing with the issue of the palestinian diaspora .
on monday a hamas delegation began talks in cairo regarding the formation of the new palestinian government . after the leaders of the movement held two meetings , they met in the evening with suleiman . they will meet with him again today , tuesday .

the head of israel 's domestic security agency warns against " jewish terrorism . "
jerusalem 2-7 ( afp ) - during a meeting with young settlers on the west bank , aired by the israeli channel 2 television monday night , the head of israel 's domestic security agency ( shin bet ) , yuval diskin , warned against the danger of " jewish terrorism " Ø²
diskin told students at a religious institute for quasi military training " i will be perfectly honest with you , if a jew carries out a terrorist attack he would ultimately be considered a cancer to the nation , and would constitute a much greater danger than hamas , " referring to the islamic resistance movement .
diskin made these comments about a month ago , but his speech , which was recorded , was not broadcast by israeli channel 10 until monday evening .
" i assure you that we will prosecute a jewish terrorist who kills an arab as vigorously as we would an arab who kills a jew , " he added . but he acknowledged that that an arab receives " severer treatment than a jew accused of committing the same offenses . "
he expressed his great apprehension about the " hard - line tendency " among young settlers who are using violence to express their opposition to the dismantling of the settlements .
on the other hand diskin considered that the fall of the regime of iraqi president saddam hussein was , in the long run , " harmful for israel " because of the " chaos that has spread in iraq . "
tens of thousands of settlers and right - wing extremists rallied sunday night in west jerusalem . the theme of the rally was " olmert is bad for the jews , " referring to the acting prime minister .
on one of the signs they wrote , " olmert is leading us to a civil war " referring to the demolishing of nine houses built in the unauthorized amona settlement near ramallah in the west bank .
during the dismantling operation there were clashes between the settlers and the police that left 200 wounded , the majority of whom had minor injuries .

tehran 2/08 ( afp ) - an official in the islamic revolutionary guard , the ideological army of the iranian regime , condemned the recent statements by german chancellor angela merkel concerning the iranian nuclear issue saying that " she thinks she 's hitler . "
commandant sayyid massoud al-jazayeri said in statements today , wednesday , that " in her childish dreams , merkel imagines she 's hitler , and believes that now that she occupies the chancellor 's seat she can dictate her orders to the world and the free countries . "
the head of the public relations department of the revolutionary guards added in statements broadcast by the iranian student news agency , " we can not expect anything else from people who have a zionist past . "
on saturday merkel expressed her opinion at a conference on security in munich , saying that " iran has deliberately crossed the red line " with its nuclear program , and it has to accept negotiation on basis of the russian proposal .
merkel called on tehran to " seize the opportunity while it is still available . " she said " we want -- and it is our duty -- to prevent iran from developing nuclear weapons " in a speech concerned with the german defense policy .
jazayeri said that " the manner in which the europeans have moved with regard to the iranian nuclear issue betrays the weakness and ineptitude of countries such as france , germany , and britain . "
he stressed that " the european nations should ask one another why their leaders , particularly in france , britain , and germany , act as if they are the servants of an american cowboy " in a reference to the american president , george bush .
jazayeri said , " i promise you that the childish joy of the american officials and the zionist regime following the referral of the iranian nuclear issue to the security council will not last . "
hamas rejects what certain parties in fatah consider dangerous for palestinian national project
by tahir al-majdhub
a reprint with a clarification in the fourth paragraph
ramallah ( the west bank ) 2/08 ( afp ) - some circles in the fatah movement expressed their fear that the palestinian national project may be jeopardized by the coming to power of the islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) in the palestinian authority . but the islamic movement has strongly rejected this suggestion .
adnan al-dumayry , a fatah leader in the west bank , emphasized to agence france - presse that " hamas , as part of the global muslim brothers movement , is not concerned with the regional issue of the palestinian state as much as it is concerned with the issue of islam as an international movement . "
he said that " the other side is that hamas is a resistance movement that can be compared to the taliban movement and the chechen movement , and this feature distinguishes it from other islamic movements in the arab and islamic world . but hamas has not carried out operations outside palestine . "
al-dumayri , who was nominated by the fatah movement in the last elections but did not win , believes that the difference between hamas and fatah is that " fatah has a program which calls for trying through negotiations to establish a palestinian state in the west bank and the gaza strip , with east jerusalem as its capital on basis of the 1967 borders , and that fatah regards this as a strategic solution , while hamas considers it a phase . "
in the same context , a palestinian official who refused to reveal his identity emphasized that " hamas belongs to the islamic movement that is not interested in establishing a regional state as much as it is interested in establishing the islamic caliphate . accordingly , its interests may intersect with those of tehran and damascus , and it is a potential ally of hezbollah in lebanon and iran , and the muslim brothers in any country . "
he added , " even syria may make use of it within the framework of its continuing its policy aiming at trying to manipulate the palestinian and lebanese issues in order to put pressure on israel , especially since the baath party also itself regards the regional issue as secondary with respect to arab nationalism .
therefore , if hamas accepts a truce with israel for 10 or 15 years , it may give up the issue of liberation and concentrate on imposing the islamic project on the society , as he said .
more than one official in hamas has stressed that the islamic movement which is now preparing to form the new palestinian government is ready to enter into long - term truce with israel .
in an interview with france - presse , hamas representative mahmoud al-rumhi , strenuously denied that hamas is jeopardizing the palestinian national project .
he said , " there is no basis of truth to this claim . the unilateral israeli policy began before the victory of hamas . it happened while the fatah movement was still in power because the 1994 oslo agreements did not set a date for ending settlement activity , and it did not define the borders of the palestinian state . " so the movement bears no responsibility for jeopardizing the palestinian project .
he also added that within the context of the same unilateral policy , israel decided " to withdraw from the gaza strip and build the separation wall before the victory of hamas , and even before a date was set for the legislative elections , and before hamas 's decision to participate in them . " he emphasized that " israel does not respect any of the agreements that have been made , and the negotiations have not ended that . the only solution is continued resistance . "
the head of the hamas political bureau , khaled meshal , declared today , wednesday , that the movement might observe " a long - term truce " with israel if it withdrew to the 1967 borders and " recognized palestinian rights . "
al-rumhi said , " such a truce is contingent on the establishment of a palestinian state within the 1967 borders , including east jerusalem , and the release of the prisoners . " he emphasized , " if these conditions can not be met , and if israel does not release any prisoners and does not withdraw from the west bank , hamas will no longer be bound by the cease - fire to which it agreed in the cairo agreement . "
ahmad saadat , secretary general of the popular front for the liberation of palestine , told france - presse from his prison in jericho , " we have no fears that any palestinian party might give up the palestinian project because the battle is basically with the israeli occupation . we have not heardd from the hamas movement that it will give up any of the principles of the palestinian issue under any banner or program . "
he stressed that " adhering to these principles and resisting the occupation are common denominators , " and " the resistance is linked to the occupation . "
saadat added " we are waiting for what hamas has to offer . what is required from all forces within the palestinian society is a democratic vision and an internal consensus with regard to the election of members of the legislative council as the first step . the second step must be the participation of our expatriate citizens through direct election . "
noteworthy is the fact that both the popular front and hamas reject the oslo agreements and the roadmap .
bassam al-salhi , deputy for the alternative parliamentary bloc ( people 's party - leftist ) , believes that " it is still premature to jump to general or hasty conclusions for a number of reasons , among which is the fact that the victory of hamas does not necessarily mean a definite political imbalance . "
rather , he called for " a reexamination of the results because hamas support in the palestinian street is no more than half the electorate , at 40% . " he added , " i believe that the program of the plo -- independence , international legitimacy , and the arab peace initiative -- has the support of the majority in the palestinian street . "
al-salhi said , " it is very difficult for any political movement to reach agreements with less than this program . "
al-salhi also noted that his bloc " is considering proposing a draft resolution in the legislative council or in the central council of the plo to declare the 1967 borders as the borders of the palestinian state , with jerusalem as its capital , and demanding the world 's recognition of this because the issue of borders is not an issue for negotiations but an issue of conflict . "
al-salhi also stressed , " we now believe that the first and foremost task is to rebuild the palestinian democratic movement on a more open basis for its political and social domains based on a declaration of independence , because that would define a social vision for the political system based on a secular system . "
suzuki to declare its future in world championship rallies soon
tokyo , 2/8 ( afp ) - the suzuki corporation of japan declared that it will soon reveal its plans for participating in world championship rallies or not , without giving details about this matter .
david farquhar , media officer and head of the public relations department at the japanese corporation , declared that an announcement will be made in the sidelines during the geneva automobile show at the end of this month .
many parties in the world rally competition believe that suzuki may join the family of official manufacturers starting next year , since it now participates in the junior w.r.c. category with the swift s1600 . it won the title in the sweden rally , the first phase of the championship for this group , and the second phase of the w.r.c. championship with its swedish driver per - gunnar andersen .
suzuki participated in many rallies outside these two categories , constituting preparation for the possibility of officially joining the senior category in the world championship . these expectations were supported by today 's announcement that it will make a decision concerning this matter on the 28th of this month at two o'clock geneva local time .
if it decides to participate , this would constitute a great support for the championship , especially after the withdrawal of the two french companies -- citroen , the world champion for the past three years , and peugeot -- as well as the japanese mitsubishi , the czech skoda , and the korean hyundai from official participation .
citroen will return to the championship next year with its new vehicle , the c4 , instead of the xara . the company gives quasi - official support to the belgian company kronos racing ( citroen xara ) , and to its two drivers the french sebastien loeb , the world champion for the past two years , and his spanish colleague xavier pons . it also supports his compatriot daniel sordo , last year 's junior w.r.c. champion , who is following in the steps of loeb himself , who was crowned champion of this category before moving to the senior category .
in the event of suzuki 's participation and the return of citroen next year the number of official manufacturers in the championship will rise to four , with subaru and ford , which won the first two phases of this year 's championship with its new driver , the finnish markus groenholm . other participation in the " special category " is limited , as is the case with the finn tony gardmeister ( astra racing -- peugeot307 ) , who did not participate in sweden 's rally after coming in third in monaco , the french gil panizzi ( red pole - skoda ) , and the italian gigi galli who is participating at his own expense ( 2005 mitsubishi lancer w ) .
israeli minister considers putin 's invitation to hamas " stab in the back "
jerusalem 2/10 ( afp ) - israeli minister of education meir sheetrit , today , friday , characterized russian president vladimir putin 's invitation to hamas leaders to visit moscow as " a real stab in the back " of israel .
in a statement to the israeli public broadcasting service the minister said that " this initiative is a real stab in the back because its goal is to give international legitimacy to a terrorist group . we have to oppose it by all means . "
the minister continued , " what would moscow say if we invited representatives of chechnya to visit jerusalem ? "
sheetrit added , " russia , which prevents the holding of free elections in chechnya , cannot give us ethical lectures about the legitimacy of hamas after the elections . "
for his part , housing minister zeev boim said in a press release that " putin is playing with fire " and characterized the russian position as " very troubling . "
on thursday evening , a high - ranking israeli official expressed israel 's great displeasure with the latest russian position . he said that " when the chechens carry out an attack in moscow , russia considers it an act of terrorism , but that is not what it is when it takes place in jerusalem , " in reference to dozens of suicide operations carried out by hamas over 10 years .
on thursday , putin declared in madrid that he would " soon " invite hamas officials to moscow to hold discussions about the future of the peace process between israel and the palestinians .
putin , whose country does not classify hamas as a terrorist organization , recently expressed his opinion that the european union would be committing " a big mistake " if it decides to suspend financial aid to the palestinians .
the russian president stressed that hamas came to power following democratic elections and " the choice of the palestinian people must be respected . "
changes in al-utri 's government , and vice president al-shara given foreign affairs
by nasib azar
damascus 2/11 ( afp ) - syrian president bashar al-assad issued three presidential decrees today , saturday , making cabinet changes that bring 14 new ministers into the government . in particular , changes have been introduced to the posts concerned with foreign affairs . this coincides with the external pressure campaign that has preoccupied syria for more than a year .
by virtue of the first decree , foreign minister farouk al-shara was appointed as " vice president in charge of implementing foreign affairs and media policies . "
the second decree introduced changes to the government of muhammad naji al-utri , bringing 14 new ministers into the government in sensitive posts such as foreign affairs , interior , and information . walid mualem was appointed minister of foreign affairs after serving as a deputy to the minister of foreign affairs farouk al-shara .
the third decree appointed syria 's representative to the united nations , faysal al-miqdad , as a deputy to the foreign minister , as a successor to mualem .
the cabinet reshuffle did not include the office of prime minister which remains occupied by muhammad naji al-utri , while general bassam abd al-majid was appointed minister of interior , replacing ghazi kanaan , who committed suicide last october 12th .
general abd al-majid was the head of the military police in syria since 2002 . before that he was an official in the intelligence service of the southern region of syria . he was born in quneitra in 1950 .
in the ministry of information , mahdi dakhlallah was dismissed and replaced by muhsin bilal , who was syria 's ambassador to spain for many years . he is also a teacher at damascus university .
sufyan allaw was appointed minister of petroleum and mineral resources to succeed ibrahim haddad ghiyath barakat was appointed minister of higher education to succeed hani murtada .
minister of defense hassan turkomany remained in his post , as did buthayna sha'ban , minister of expatriates , muhammad al-husayn , minister of finance , and amir husni lutfi , minister of economy and trade .
joseph suwayd was appointed as minister of state . he is the first member in the syrian national social party to be appointed as minister since the party has joined the national front in 2005 .
the baath party got the lion 's share in the government , given 19 ministries , including the office of prime minister . seven ministers from seven parties represented in the national progressive front were appointed , in addition to seven independent ministers .
the national progressive front includes an assembly of 10 parties headed by the baath party .
usually all nine parties in the national front other than the baath party were represented by one minister in the government . but the current cabinet reshuffle left two parties unrepresented : the arab socialist union party , headed by safwan qudsi , and the movement of socialist unionists , headed by ghassan abd al-aziz uthman .
the other parties of the front are represented by six ministers of state , while the communist party was given the ministry of irrigation , represented by yusuf al-faysal .
this cabinet reshuffle was not a surprise since there has been talk about it since the suicide of minister of interior ghazi kanaan whose post has been vacant since his death last october 12th .
these ministerial changes coincide with an international pressure campaign that syria was confronted with a result of the investigation into the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafiq al-hariri , since two reports by the international investigation committee pointed out to the involvement of lebanese and syrian security personnel in the assassination .
the united states also accuses syria of facilitating the infiltration of arab fighters into iraq across syrian territory .
yemeni president ali abdallah salih makes cabinet change after escape of 23 al-qaeda members
by hammoud mansar
sanaa 2/11 ( afp ) - yemeni president ali abdallah salih today , saturday , made a change in his cabinet , as reported by the yemeni saba news agency , after the escape of 23 supposed members of al-qaeda from a yemeni prison last week .
the yemeni president decided to keep prime minister abd al-qadar ba jamal as the head of government , and dismissed minister of defense abdallah ali ulaywa and 15 other ministers .
the yemeni president dismissed deputy prime ministers ' ulwi al-salami and ahmad sufan who respectively held the posts of minister of finance and minister of planning .
minister of the interior rashad al-ulaymi kept his post and he also became the only deputy prime minister .
brigadier general muhammad nasir ahmad ali was appointed minister of defense .
the outgoing cabinet was formed in may 2003 after the victory of the ruling general people 's congress party in the legislative elections .
the cabinet change comes in the wake of criticism directed at the yemeni government , particularly by the united states , after the escape of 23 alleged al-qaeda members from a prison run by the yemini intelligence service in sanaa last saturday .
among the fugitives are 13 men convicted of the bombing of the american destroyer cole and the french oil tanker limburg . the most prominent among them is jamal al-badawi who was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment in the case of the bombing of the us destroyer in 2000 in which 17 american soldiers were killed .
the yemeni authorities carried out a campaign to track the fugitives and arrested around 95 of their relatives in an attempt to force them to turn themselves in .
the prisoners escaped through a 44 meter long tunnel that connected their prison cell to a nearby mosque . the diameter of the tunnel did not exceed 70 centimeters .
warships of the u.s. - led coalition forces that cruise the waters facing yemen participated in the search for the 23 fugitives , and interpol issued an international notification of their escape .
yemen is the country from which the family of osama bin laden , the leader of al qaeda who claimed responsibility for the attack , originates .
since the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the united states , yemen has worked with washington to suppress those suspected of supporting al-qaeda in yemen .
on another front , a yemeni court today , saturday , rejected an appeal submitted by three al-qaeda prisoners -- one of whom is among the fugitives -- convicted of planning attacks on western targets in gulf countries

birmingham ( united states ) 2/13 ( afp ) - ten churches were set on fire in ten days in the state of alabama in the southern united states . the police suspect two men , but the motives for committing these acts , which are reminiscent of earlier racist acts , are unknown .
the latest crime was on saturday when the beaverton freewill baptist church , 145 km northwest of birmingham , was set on fire .
authorities have declared that it is too early to link the previous fires and this tenth occurrence to the same type of incident .
these acts did not result in any casualties , but they caused extensive damage .
this series of incidents began with the torching of five churches in bibb county on february 3rd .
four days later , another four churches were set on fire in three neighboring counties in western alabama .
the police , who have a lot of evidence , are searching for two white men in their twenties or thirties , and a blue car that was seen near the churches .
the police also announced a $ 20,000 reward for anyone who helps in the arrest of the criminals .
investigators are currently unable to predict the motives for those who committed these actions , but they believe that those who are doing it are trying to get the attention of the media .
during the fifties and sixties of the last century , many churches attended by black people were targeted in the state of alabama .
the wave of burnings targeting churches attended by a majority of blacks goes back to 1995 and 1996 , when more than 30 religious structures were burned in tennessee , louisiana , alabama , and south carolina .

saddam hussein entered the courtroom wearing a blue dishdasha and a black jacket . as he entered , he chanted " down with traitors ! down with traitors ! down with bush ! long live the nation ! long live the nation ! long live the nation ! "
the former president told the judge that he was forced to enter the courtroom .
this was followed by a state of chaos as the defendants objected to being forced to enter the courtroom . barzan ibrahim al-tikriti , saddam hussein 's half - brother , shouted at judge ra'uf rashid abd al-rahman , " you are devoid of " mercy " and you have none of the qualities suggested by your names . you are neither " praised " nor " compassionate . " you are a military ruler . you are not a judge . we do not want to sit here in this place . "
he added , " i cannot remain in this session in the absence of my lawyer . "
he continued , saying that he suffers from " an incurable disease . i was medically examined by the americans in the american camp , so you must release me to receive treatment . the law stipulates that any defendant who suffers from an incurable disease must be released . i am dying gradually . you are killing me . "
when the judge told him that the court agreed that he be examined by a medical committee , he said " if you fear god , release me so i can receive treatment while with my family . i will sign any pledge to attend the sessions . i have a case of honor here . i want to defend my honor . "
he continued , " if you think that the baath party needs me , you should know the baath party is functioning well and does not need me or anyone else . here is its secretary general ( pointing to saddam hussein ) . he has been in prison for two years . so release me to receive treatment . "
the judge replied , " you have talked too much , and have consumed too much of the court 's time . " barzan interrupted him saying , " i have the right to talk till tomorrow . "
after that , barzan al-tikriti noticed that the judge was ignoring his demand to be released , so he left his seat and sat on the floor , turning his back to the judge and ignoring the proceedings of the court .
saddam , who appeared furious and carried a koran in his hand , insulted the judge for forcing him to attend the session . he said , " this is what agents do . god is great ! away with the disgraceful ones ! i curse your mustache ! "
he added , " this is not a court , this is a game . "
saddam also told the judge , " you have no right to appoint lawyers for us in place of our own lawyers , with all due respect to them for agreeing to defend us and with all due respect to every iraqi . "
the judge explained that " the court has appointed lawyers in place of the defense team in accordance with iraqi law after the defense lawyers boycotted the sessions . " saddam retorted , " they did not boycott the sessions , you threw them out . some of them were even beaten in front of you . "
judge abd al-rahman replied , " i do not permit you to speak about political matters . "
saddam interrupted him saying , " you are ignorant . what politics ? you act selectively and contrary to the law . "
the prosecution then began to recount the statements of a number of witnesses about what they had suffered at the hands of the security apparatus after being arrested in 1982 .
saddam hussein then protested , telling the chief judge , " when witnesses talk about politics , it 's allowed , but when saddam hussein and his companions talk about politics , it is forbidden . "
saddam hussein , his former assistants , and the defense team boycotted the tenth session of the trial which was held this february 8th , after agreeing with each other after the previous session following an argument with the new judge , ra'uf rashid abd al-rahman , who took over as chief judge on the special tribunal .
in a telephone call on sunday lawyer khalil al-dulaymi , head of saddam hussein 's defense team , told agence france - presse , " as head of the defense team , i can assure you that none of the defense team and none of the defendants will attend today 's session of the trial . "
ja'far al-musawi , the public prosecutor at the trial , stated that " the court will hold a meeting shortly before the court session to consider the possibility of forcing the defendants to attend or leaving them alone if they insist on not attending . "
he believes that " if the court makes any decision it must be implemented , regardless of what the decision may be . "
saddam and his assistants have been on trial since last october in the case of the killing of 148 villagers in the shiite village of al-dujail in response to an attack on the former iraqi president 's convoy during his visit to the village in 1982 .

jeddah ( saudi arabia ) 2/13 ( afp ) - the european union high representative for foreign policy , javier solana , conveyed a message of " respect " to the islamic world , while the secretary general of the organization of the islamic conference , ekmaleddin ihsanoglu , called on the europeans to adopt legislation to combat " anti - islamism . "
a meeting between the two men was held at the headquarters of the organization of the islamic conference in jeddah , on the red sea , during the crisis resulting from the publication in european newspapers of cartoons of the prophet muhammad which muslims considered offensive .
after the meeting , solana said , " as far as the european union is concerned , we have deep respect for the muslims , and we never wanted to hurt their feelings . " he stressed , " that never was and never will be our intention . "
he explained that he had conveyed this message to ihsanoglu by phone , but he insisted on delivering it in person as well .
for his part , ihsanoglu stressed the need for the europeans to adopt legislation in the european parliament , to combat " anti - islamism . "
ihsanoglu said , " unfortunately what is happening today is that the islamic world has begun to feel that it is the target of another 9/11 , a reference to the attacks against the united states in 2001 .
ihsanoglu also called for incorporating a principle stipulating the need to respect all religions and prohibiting their defamation , in the founding declaration of the new human rights council that is being established .
solana avoided a direct response to the question of enacting this kind of legislation , but he said that he does not see " any difficulty in agreeing to such a clause if it becomes part of the principles of the human rights council currently being established . "
this council will replace the current commission based in geneva , which lost a great deal of respect and credibility after it became clear that its working methods made it possible for countries not committed to human rights to be represented in it .
on wednesday solana declared that he would visit " a number of countries " in the region , including saudi arabia , to allay the anger that spread through the islamic world in the wake of the publication of these drawings .
according to the schedule of visits , after this meeting solana will head to riyadh where he will meet the saudi minister of foreign affairs prince saud al-faysal , and king abdallah bin abd al-aziz .
after saudi arabia , solana will head to egypt where he will meet president hosni mubarak , and the secretary general of the arab league , amr moussa . then he will go to jordan , and end his trip in the palestinian territories and israel .
in a speech before the jeddah economic forum on sunday the secretary general of the arab league , amr moussa , called for extinguishing " the evil spark " caused by the crisis of the publication of the drawings insulting to the prophet muhammad , rejecting a return to the " crusades . "
moussa said , " this is not the era of conflict between the east and the west . we muslims who desire positive relations should join hands with our brothers in europe and america who share this view -- and they are many -- to extinguish this evil spark .
he added , " let 's put this matter behind us , and work together with them to prevent a repetition of this . "
the drawings insulting the prophet muhammad were first published in a danish newspaper last september , before being republished in a number of other european newspapers in the name of freedom of expression .
the region witnessed a boycott of danish products and violent protest demonstrations in the arab and islamic world resulting in a number of people dead and injured .
saudi arabia , libya , and syria recalled their ambassadors from denmark
denmark recalled its ambassadors in syria , iran , and indonesia for fear for their safety .

cairo 2/14 ( afp ) -- israeli defense minister shaul mofaz today , tuesday , accused the shiite lebanese hezbollah of seeking to ignite the israel 's northern front " with support from syria and iran . "
mofaz told journalists at the end of a meeting with egyptian president hosni mubarak in cairo , that " hezbollah is using the lebanese territory as a base for its terrorist activities against israel . "
he added , " we know that syria and iran support hezbollah , and their goal is to divert the attention of the international community from syria to the lebanese - israeli border . "

( iran stresses that it will resume uranium enrichment process )
by siyafush ghazi
tehran , 2/14 ( afp ) - tehran stressed today , tuesday , that it had resumed uranium enrichment in the natanz plant , refusing to suspend its " research " in this field , while the western nations made the resumption of negotiations with tehran about its nuclear program contingent upon stopping this activity .
jawad waidi , a member of the supreme national security council , and the head of the nuclear program , declared that " work has begun " in the uranium enrichment plant in natanz ( in the middle of ) .
on monday tehran announced that the seals and the monitoring cameras belonging to the international atomic energy agency in the natanz plant had been removed .
diplomatic sources in vienna , the headquarters of the international atomic energy agency , today announced that iran had resumed enrichment activities at this site .
but waidi refused to comment on the statements which claimed that the iranians had begun the enrichment process on their own by pumping uranium hexafluoride gas into the centrifuges .
he told journalists after a speech he made before the students ' islamic society of tehran , " i cannot reply concerning these technical matters . " he stressed that it is " unacceptable for us to stop our research " since " the essence of the nuclear program is enrichment " of uranium .
the resumption of the enrichment process is what resulted in the breakdown in discussions with the europeans last august , and then again in january after they had been resumed in december .
on february 4th these countries adopted the decision in the international atomic energy agency demanding that iran suspend all its sensitive activities . it brought the iranian file to the attention of the un security council .
but instead of complying , tehran responded by declaring an end to the enhanced monitoring system installed by the international atomic energy agency over its nuclear program and the resumption of all activities that had been suspended , particularly those related to the enrichment process on a broad scale .
the natanz plant includes two enrichment units , one for a project focusing on research , the other for an industrial facility that is still under construction .
concerning this unit , waidi said that iran " needs time to complete its industrial capabilities with about 60,000 centrifuges for uranium enrichment , but we have started our activities . " he stated that his country does not see " any reason currently to re - suspend " its activities at this site .
waidi justified the series of unilateral initiatives undertaken by his country saying that " after showing good intentions over the past three years , the europeans have demanded the total abandonment of the nuclear fuel cycle . "
the europeans particularly refuse to allow iran to enrich uranium on its territory because they believe that this country has not proved that its nuclear program is purely civilian .
the enrichment process is considered basic for obtaining fuel for nuclear power plants , but it can also be used to manufacture nuclear weapons .
the international agency is expected to hold another meeting on march 6th to decide whether iran has complied with its demands , and in all probability it will decide to refer the iranian file to the un security council .
in the meantime , an iranian delegation will visit moscow on february 20th , according to waidi , to discuss the russian proposal for enriching iranian uranium on its territory .
but this proposal is contingent on the position of the iranians who are carrying out the enrichment on their territory , which is unacceptable to the western countries .

he continued , saying that for the head of an islamic country to embrace nazi anti - semitism is " a disgrace for all the muslims of the world . "

it tries to protect the archives of the islamic community going back to the 18th century , and to encourage dialogue between german muslims and other religious sects .

by nasser abu bakr
ramallah ( west bank ) 2/15 ( afp ) -- today , wednesday , the executive committee of the palestine liberation organization expressed the opinion that israeli settlement expansion is undermining opportunities for achieving peace in the region , and emphasized its full commitment to all agreements signed with the israeli government under international auspices .
a statement by the executive committee at the end of today 's meeting at the presidential headquarters in ramallah , chaired by the president of the palestinian authority , mahmoud abbas , a copy of which was obtained by agence france - presse , stated that " the executive committee spent time discussing the settlement attack that targeted the al-aghwar area in an israeli attempt to isolate this area from the rest of the palestinian territory in the west bank under well - known security and expansionist pretexts . "
it stressed " its absolute rejection of the settlement plans that tear apart our palestinian land into isolated cantons to prevent our people from establishing their independent state . "
the statement added " the executive committee headed for the quartet committee that issued the roadmap to declare its position regarding this creeping settlement activity on our land and the necessity of performing the role it has taken upon itself with regard to the peace process and establishing a two - state solution . "
it went on to say that " the continuing settlement in noble jerusalem , the racist separation wall , the isolation of the al-aghwar area in an attempt to judaize it , the crimes of assassinations , incursions , and arrests destroy any opportunity for achieving a just and permanent peace in the middle east . "
it added " a decision has been made to hold the meeting of the supreme commission chaired by salim al-zanoun ( abu al-adib ) , head of the national council , in the city of ramallah this week to discuss the current preparations for holding a meeting of the palestine central council , and to ratify plans and decisions being prepared by the supreme commission to make the organization , the executive committee , and the relevant agencies effective .

according to the statement , the committee " discussed the next meeting of the palestinian legislative council scheduled to be held on saturday " stressing " full adherence to the national principles confirmed by successive palestinian national councils , as well as compliance with the political program of the palestine liberation organization , and the declaration of independence of 1988 . "
it stressed " total commitment to all political agreements which have been signed with the government of israel under international auspices , as well as its adherence to international resolutions of legitimacy related to the palestinian issue , particularly resolution 194 concerning the right of return of palestinian refugees and the resolutions of the arab summit in beirut . "
the statement noted that " all palestinian institutions must play their political and national role , with the legislative and executive institutions in the lead , in our desire for national gains , international recognition of the organization and the authority , and the higher interests of our people . "
in a statement to agence france presse , saleh ra'fat , a member of the executive committee of the palestine liberation organization , said that " the committee has decided to launch a broad diplomatic campaign in the arab world and internationally , including the security council , the quartet committee , and the countries that are signatories of the geneva agreements , in order to confront the israeli policy aiming to annex the settlement blocs and the al-aghwar area and to draw the borders unilaterally . "
he added " the executive committee emphasized that members of the new legislative council are members of the national council . therefore , the hamas movement joins the palestine national council , which is considered the parliament of the liberation organization , which also qualifies it to participate in all the organization 's institutions , which the hamas movement had reservations about joining . "
he continued , saying , " the executive committee discussed president abbas 's speech which he will deliver during the inauguration ceremony for the new legislative council next saturday . "
ra'fat said that the speech " will stress adherence to the liberation organization 's political line , and will mention that any head of a palestinian government will be entrusted with and committed to the palestinian , arab , and international resolutions of legitimacy . "
rice admits mistakes have been made by american administration in rebuilding iraq
washington 2/16 ( afp ) -- american secretary of state condoleezza rice was forced to admit today , thursday , during a congressional hearing that some mistakes were made by the american administration in the reconstruction of iraq .
after being showered with questions by kent conrad , democratic senator from north dakota , on the results of the reconstruction programs for which the united states has spent more than $ 20 billion , rice had to admit that the american administration had made two mistakes , one related to the training of iraqi forces , and the second to infrastructure .
the secretary , who was giving her testimony before the senate budget committee , said that the number of the iraqi security forces is now 227,000 .
she explained , " to be frank , we made a mistake in the beginning , when we relied on quantity and not on quality . the members who are currently there are qualified . "
in her talk about " the development of a large part of the infrastructure " by the united states , especially as far as clean water and water purification are concerned , under the pressure of the senator 's questions rice admitted that the number of iraqis who now have clean water and a sewage system is less than what it was before the war .
she added , " you are right , we focused our efforts on enhancing capacities for securing these services , " and not on the local water distribution and purification networks .
conrad replied saying " we can improve capacities , and this is very good . but what is important for the people in the end is to get these services . "
strange laws add novelty to england
by jalal malti
london 2/17 ( afp ) - england has a group of old laws and traditions , some of which are strange , and some funny , that are still effective , even if not enforced . in any case , they interest law students for their oddity .
among these laws is a law that goes back to 1279 and stipulates that " members of parliament are not allowed to wear armor " inside the parliament . the purpose of this law was to avert fights and duals that would lead to killings between lords in a country of ancient democratic traditions .
also among these strange laws is one prohibiting deputies from dying in westminster palace . if that should happen , the body must be taken out of parliament before a death certificate is issued .
nigel cawthorne , the author of a book entitled , " the strange laws of old england " that discusses these amazing obsolete provisions , explains that this law stemmed from the fact that westminster palace is a royal palace , and anyone who dies in a royal palace is entitled to an official funeral .
members of parliament have the right to gamble and drink alcohol freely in westminster , the library included , while their fellow citizens are fined for such behavior by virtue of the transgressions in libraries law of 1898 .
in england there are more than 4,000 national laws , 11,000 local laws , and 13,000 special laws that go back to before 1801 , and they are still in effect .
cawthorne told agence france presse that " the tradition of law is very important " in england , explaining that " things change , but very slowly , and laws are added one after another . "
as a matter of fact , mps have enacted legislation related to many aspects of everyday life , including the very ordinary aspects . in the 19th century , during the height of the industrial revolution , they enacted a number of laws aimed at regulating life in the suburbs .
this desire led , for instance , to prohibiting hanging laundry in the streets , singing obscene songs , firing a weapon for no reason , lighting a fire in the garden , playing with kites , skating on ice , disturbing residents by knocking on their doors for no reason , turning on public lights " willfully and illegally , " and other laws that have become funny today .
some of these laws have not been enforced for a long time , because of the progress that has been made since they were enacted . one of the oddest is a law prohibiting riding a horse , a cow , or a motorcar when drunk ( 1872 ) .
a law going back to 1867 prohibits " anyone living less than a mile from a weapons or explosives warehouse " from owning a paper toy . a law enacted in 1839 provides for punishing anyone who fires a cannon near a house .
kevin martin , president of the law society in charge of suggesting laws that should be abolished , said that " these unusual examples portray the old history of the tradition of law in this country , and they prove the perpetual need for updating the law , and adapting it to reality . "
more than 2,000 legal provisions have been abolished since 1965 in a huge process to modernize the laws .
however , british mps insist on continuing to enact strange laws , such as " the outer space law " of 1986 that prohibits any british citizen from " throwing an object into space " without an official permit , and defines space as including " the moon and all other heavenly bodies . "
in their wisdom they authorized judges to issue orders " with the use of a reasonable amount of force " to respond to a possible attack by aliens .
sunni imam warns against celebrating valentine 's day
baghdad - 2/17 ( afp ) -- three days after valentine 's day , in a friday sermon a sunni imam attacked valentine 's day and those who celebrate it in iraq , expressing his belief that it " lures youth away from virtue to vice . "
in their sermons today , friday , most imams of mosques in iraq focused on the photos of the abuse of detainees that go back to 2004 , while others focused on the bad services and the difficult security situation in the country . however , sheikh mahmoud al-sumaydii , imam of the umm al-qura mosque , focused on valentine 's day which is celebrated worldwide on the 14th of this month . he expressed the belief that it has nothing to do with islam .
he said , " the international valentine 's day was two or three days ago and , unfortunately , a large number of our young men and women behaved on this day in a way that satisfied the enemy ; they exchanged gifts , words , and even kisses . this is how our enemies want us to live , away from virtue . "
valentine 's day is a very popular day in iraq , as it is in the other countries around the world . young men exchange sweets , flowers , perfume , and other gifts with their girlfriends .
al-sumaydii added that " every invasion has its goals . the goal of the invasion of our country is to seize our youth and lure them away from virtue to vice . "
celebrating this occasion in iraq goes back to before the american occupation in 2003 . a large celebration was held on this occasion during the time of the regime of the deposed president saddam hussein . the official television also used to present special programs on this occasion .
it is noteworthy that uday , the son of the iraqi president , was famous for holding large parties on valentine 's day in the halls of the hunting club in the upscale al-mansour district that used to last until the early hours of the morning .
al-sumaydii said that " there is no mention of international valentine 's day within the context of islam , and muslims should live in accordance with their religion . "
berlusconi signs agreement with extreme right in italy
rome , 2/17 ( afp ) - italian prime minister silvio berlusconi today , friday , seven weeks before the legislative elections , signed a political agreement with the neo - fascist movement , the social alternative , headed by alessandra mussolini , grand - daughter of the italian dictator benito mussolini .
with mussolini present , berlusconi announced , " we have reached an agreement concerning the program between the house of freedoms ( the ruling coalition ) and the social alternative , " thereby expanding his electoral alliance to the extreme right .
the alliance with the social alternative in preparation for the election scheduled for april 9th and 10th angered the rest of berlusconi 's allies because of the presence of controversial figures belonging to the neo - fascist extreme right in this formation .
berlusconi said emphatically , " our family photo album is ideal . it is pure white . "
a solution was reached when mussolini and her two troublesome allies , roberto fiore , the leader of forza nuova ( new force ) , and adriano tilgher , the leader of the national social front , decided on thursday that they would not personally be candidates on the house of freedom coalition lists , and proposed other nominations .
massimo d'alema , president of the democrats of the left ( the largest opposition party ) , expressed the opinion , today , friday , that " it is a very serious matter that berlusconi has signed agreements with the neo - fascist extreme right . "
ignazio larussa , the leader of the national alliance deputies ( right wing conservative , springing from the movement that is the heir to fascism ) , the second party in berlusconi 's coalition , emphasized that despite the withdrawal from candidacy of the social alternative leaders , " the fundamental problem is still in sharing basic values and the political program . "
mussolini 's party calls for rejecting turkey 's inclusion in the european union and rejection of the european arrest memorandum and abortion laws . it calls for deporting immigrants and signing a new agreement with the catholic church , and it criticizes american imperialism .

the study expressed the opinion that terrorism is not a danger of a universal nature because it is mainly concentrated in one area , the middle east .
on the other hand , " local " terrorism committed by citizens of a state against targets in their own country witnessed a big increase between 2004 and 2005 , as the number of attacks increased by 90% while the number of victims increased by 60% .
the study expressed the opinion that this increase resulted almost entirely from the situation in iraq .
it also expressed the belief that " the conflict in iraq , which has been presented as an element in the war against terrorism , has contributed to making iraq today a center for terrorism . "
relying on these figures , rick kulsat said in a telephone conversation , " imagine how the islamic world views these numbers with the west 's insistence on saying that it is the one that is being threatened with terrorism . "
the study revealed that " the notion that international terrorism represents a fundamental foreign threat is not supported by the facts . "
in the same context , kulsat said , " jihadi terrorism does not constitute the existential threat that we believe it is , even if it represents a challenge to our societies . "
this study , the second of its kind , relied on data that it obtained from the renowned institution the rand corporation and the national memorial for protection against terrorism and its terrorism database .
berlusconi faces difficulty dismissing minister accused of insulting islam
by christian spillman
rome 2/18 ( afp ) - italian prime minister silvio berlusconi today , saturday , plunged into a struggle with his allies in the northern league to make it possible to dismiss one of their leaders , minister of reform roberto calderoli , in order to calm the tension caused in the islamic world by his statements insulting to islam .
the prime minister asked calderoli to resign , emphasizing , at the same time , today , saturday , that " he has no authority to force him " to do so .
the minister concerned replied that he is ready to resign " if i am asked to by umberto bossi , the leader of the northern league , and if the islamic world makes an initiative to calm things down . "
the italian minister is accused of insulting islam by wearing a cotton shirt bearing the cartoons insulting the prophet muhammad , which caused a serious international crisis . he was wearing the cotton shirt on thursday , and appeared with it on the evening news broadcast on italian channel one , rai .
this initiative of his , as well as other accusations against islam which he made in press statements on friday , led to violent demonstrations against italy in libya in which ten people were killed on friday .
roberto calderoli does not intend to apologize . the newspaper corrieri della sera quoted him today , saturday , saying , " i do not feel responsible for these deaths . "
in a statement to the newspaper la repubblica he emphasized " western civilization is being intimidated . "
silvio berlusconi shocked the islamic world two weeks after the attacks on the united states when , on september 26 , 2001 , he spoke emphatically about the " superiority of western civilization . " he has had great difficulty in correcting the ramifications of these statements .
calderoli , 49 years old , a former physician who specialized in face and jaw surgery , is considered to be among the hardliners in the northern league , a movement hostile to foreigners that is allied with berlusconi .
he joined the government in july , 2004 to replace bossi , the leader of the league , who was forced to resign after suffering a heart attack . the league holds three ministries : justice , labor , and reform .
roberto calderoli asserted emphatically that he enjoys the support of umberto bossi and his party , in addition to " the support of many italians who think like me . "
he boastingly told the newspaper la repubblica " silvio berlusconi has asked me to resign , but i have not resigned yet . "
the italian authorities fear that today , saturday , new anti - italy demonstrations will take place in the islamic world , not to mention reactions in italy .
berlusconi announced that he had asked , minister of interior giuseppe pisanu to ensure that the northern league offices are monitored . he stressed that " all protective measures have been taken to ensure the safety of italian missions abroad . "
minister of foreign affairs gianfranco fini declared his intention to visit the mosque of rome today , saturday , in an attempt to calm the tension caused by calderoli 's statements .
this is not the first time the prime minister has faced the northern league to demand the resignation of one of its ministers from the government .
in july 2003 , he was forced to negotiate with umberto bossi to dismiss deputy minister of tourism stefano stefani , who made offensive statements about german tourists .
the confrontation lasted for a week and caused a crisis in diplomatic relations with germany , which was primarily offended by insults made by silvio berlusconi personally to a german lawmaker whom he compared to a guard in a nazi camp .
this new crisis comes at a critical stage for the prime minister who is immersed in a difficult campaign within the framework of the legislative elections scheduled for april 9th and 10th . maurizio gasparri , one of the leaders of the national alliance ( right ) said that the crisis " occurred at a time when we have begun to improve our position according to opinion polls . "

italian minister roberto calderoli resigns
rome , 2/18 ( afp ) -- the italian news agency ( ansa ) reported that the minister of reform roberto calderoli announced today , saturday , his resignation from the italian government due to pressure from his colleagues in the government after libya expressed the opinion that he was responsible for the violent demonstration in which ten people were killed in benghazi because of his statements and actions insulting islam .
calderoli told journalists , " i resigned . "

police officer killed and four wounded in two separate attacks in iraq

he said that " unidentified armed men killed lieutenant uday khayun at 7:00 pm local time . "
on another front , the same source said that " a suicide bomber driving a booby - trapped car detonated his vehicle near the al-mahmudiya courthouse 30 km south of baghdad , targeting iraqi police and causing the injury of four of them .

with events : solana between his mind and his heart . by nur al-din ashur
the question brought about by the current tour of the european union 's foreign policy coordinator , javier solana , is not about its odds of success so much as it is about whether solana was ruled by his mind or his heart to volunteer to attempt to calm the islamic public opinion after the publication by many european newspapers of the offensive cartoons of the prophet muhammad .
now that solana is in the middle east , he seems to have listened to his heart after being upset by the publication of the drawings , and he felt what the muslims felt about the insult they suffered in the name of freedom of expression , since he did not hesitate to declare that " as far as the european union is concerned , we have deep respect for the muslims ..
.. and we would never want to hurt their feelings . "
this is part of what the european official said after his recent meeting with the secretary general of the organization of the islamic conference .
if the coordinator of european foreign policy had opted to listen to his mind ( and this is purely hypothetical ) , he would have spared himself the trouble of going to the middle east , whether to apologize or to " convince , " and the crisis would have been settled within a european framework since denmark is a member in the european union , and its economic interests are being threatened ..
does it make sense for a certain party to rush to the offended party to calm him down and make it easier for him before condemning the offender , and making him understand that what he had done is unacceptable ?
during world war ii , was hitler left free to implement his aggressive plans and racist ideas while the allied countries were content to console the european nations , including the jews ?
the most dangerous aspect of the matter is that there are attempts to convince the muslims of the correctness of the european attitude which still has not discarded the pretext of freedom of expression in the context of publishing the drawings . so that does not solve the crisis . instead there are people who pay with their lives the price for objecting to the drawings . as a result , europe succeeded in achieving two things . first , it diluted the question , keeping it within the context of freedom of publication . second , it exported the crisis to the islamic countries where it was simplified into acts of chaos and violence .
therefore , solana 's mere transformation into a man of good intentions towards the islamic world indicates that the european union has not yet grasped the feelings of the muslims , who do not reject freedom of expression , but do not want it to be a means of spreading hate and violation of religious feelings .
when we will hear about the enactment of a european law , then an international law , criminalizing opposition to religions and the violation of things that are sacred , solana 's endeavors will really be worthy of praise .
lakhdar ibrahimi and iraq 's mandela by asiya al-' atrus
because recognition of failure and admitting defeat have never been easy terms to find their way in the lexicon of international diplomacy in general , and arab diplomacy in particular , especially when it comes to the war in iraq , and its events , accompanying circumstances , and clandestine actions that may not be revealed until a long period of time has elapsed , what was stated by the veteran algerian politician lakhdar ibrahimi regarding his impossible mission in iraq cannot pass without notice or without calling for contemplation .
because lakhdar ibrahimi is also virtually the only arab maghrebi diplomat who consented to venture so closely and undertake a mission that is not free of risks both to himself and to his career , by moving to an arab country that suffers occupation and destruction , it was very natural , under the most serious recent circumstances witnessed by the iraqi arena in the past two and a half years , that his mission will give rise to a great deal of controversy about the reasons and motives that might impel a man with ibrahimi 's weight and experience to accept a role under the administration of the american occupation , which has been evident in his positions from the beginning , as he did not hesitate to admit that the decision of war was made outside the framework of international legitimacy . lakhdar ibrahimi linked the success of his mission in south africa during the apartheid era to the presence of a leader like mandela who was capable of establishing the truth and reconciliation commission , and uniting his people around him to realize a dream that had seemed impossible a few years ago .
there is no doubt that when ibrahimi , the former advisor to the united nations secretary general , who has had a considerable career in various areas of diplomatic activity , and has made efforts in many crises in the developing countries , acknowledges the failure of his mission and specifies the reasons and the types of mistakes he made , without any twitching or dying delusions , he sheds the image of the stubborn and obstinate diplomat who is aware of being wrong but refuses to admit it and insists on continuing the way of making mistakes because his pride and arrogance prevent him from doing that despite his conviction of the repercussions and dangers that can result as a consequence .
.
in an interview with an arabic newspaper , ibrahimi admitted his failure in his mission in iraq , which he described as impossible under the various kinds of vetoes that he faced while carrying out his mission . ibrahimi , who was , and still is , known as mission impossible man , did not deny the embarrassment he feels for having agreed to work with the occupation authorities in iraq , and under such thorny circumstances , claiming at the same time that what impelled him to accept this task was the american administration 's assurances that it was trying to end the occupation in the shortest time possible , which turned out not to be true , after it became clear that all the american administration is interested in is not finding a solution to the current situation in iraq as much as finding a solution to the problem that it had created for itself in iraq , especially before the american public opinion which has come to realize that the reasons which the administration in the white house used to justify the war were illusory and based on false reports .
perhaps the reasons that made ibrahimi admit his failure are not limited to a single reason but rather they are connected to a series of reasons , the most important of which is his realization that occupation , wherever it is , produces resistance , and resistance produces oppression , torture , and secret prisons , and that in any case the military option can not be the solution that is required in iraq .
ibrahimi 's admissions reflect a reality of iraq for many months , not only in the amount of material losses , and the effects of demolition and destruction , but more importantly in the amount of human losses , the psychological trauma , destruction , and homelessness , while the absence of an influential national figure capable of rallying the iraqis and uniting them is still a very important matter in helping to emerge from the current situation and to overcome the challenges of the coming phase .
so is it possible after such long suffering of the iraqis to reconsider the wrong policy in iraq , to save whatever can be saved , and give the iraqis a chance to regain their sovereignty , far from any sort of guardianship and imported solutions in cans of democracy ?
news analysis : after hamas 's victory and its alliance with damascus , tehran , and moscow , will washington retreat from its political projects in the arab world ?
by kamal ibn yunis
tunisia - morning - after the hamas movement won a majority in the palestinian parliamentary elections pressure increased on the american administration to convince it to give up its projects which call for political and economic reform in the vast middle east -- that is , in the arab and islamic world extending from morocco to indonesia -- so that the " radical movement " hostile to washington and the west will not benefit from these elections ..
especially since all american and european opinion polls
indicate a likely increase in feelings of opposition to the policies of the united states and the atlantic capitals among arab and islamic public opinion because of the wars in afghanistan and iraq and the bias of the u.s. administration and the majority of western governments towards sharon 's government during its campaign of repression against the palestinian people and their leaders over the past five years ..
according to the british newspaper financial times , the administration of american president george bush is currently reconsidering its declared plans to spread democracy in the middle east region after the overwhelming victory of the islamic hamas movement in the latest palestinian legislative elections .
the newspaper reported that the " neo - conservatives " close to the american president have started to reconsider their plans for spreading democracy in the middle east after the overwhelming victory of the hamas movement . "
it added that since the results of these elections became known the bush administration has been bombarded with " a flood of reports and studies advising it to deliberate and slow down the matter of spreading democracy in the middle east . "
discontinuation of pressuring regimes
many recommendations have also been issued by the conservative research centers and think tanks that support the republican administration in the white house , calling upon it " not to exert pressure on the arab regimes " and to stop supporting the " approach of imposing the model of spreading democracy in eastern europe on countries of the islamic region . "
advocates of the position opposed to the democratization of the arab islamic region link the hamas victory with the electoral gains made by the extremist movement in the iranian elections , and the winning of five seats in the parliament by muslim brotherhood candidates for the first time in egypt ..
security and military alliance
according to the financial times and numerous european and american sources , " despite the criticisms directed by the administration towards the egyptian regime because of its violations of law during the last legislative elections , " the u.s. budget for 2007 is expected to see an increase in the amount of military and security aid given by washington to cairo as " an important ally in the war against terrorism . " ..
in other words , the priority of washington and its european allies will be security related rather than political .
hamas 's alliance with washington 's adversaries
this controversy that is continuing in the european and american media is aggravated by numerous issues , among them the following :
* the support of the hamas movement ( and its upcoming government ) by some countries considered as major adversaries by washington and some european capitals , particularly syria , iran , sudan , russia , venezuela , and the list may go on to include other countries like cuba , korea , china , and a number of arab and islamic countries ..
* the objective alliance between tehran , moscow , beijing , and many european and asian countries against the option of imposing sanctions on iran because of the iranian nuclear issue ..
tehran 's foreign policy after the victory of ahmedinejad and the weakening of the moderate reformist movement headed by mohammad khatami and his former minister of culture mohajerani ..
* the loss by most of washington 's liberal and secular allies in the iraqi elections ..
the focus of the struggle on the elections , the political game , and the iraqi security battles between sunni , shiite , and kurdish movements , parties , and groups who have many incompatibilities but the great majority of which have a religious nature ..
and do not differentiate between religion and politics ..
* the continuing security disturbances and continuous suicide attacks against the american and the allied forces in iraq and afghanistan ( thousands of americans dead and wounded in 2005 alone ) , and against israeli targets in occupied palestine ..
despite the projects supporting reform and democracy adopted by president bush 's administration for years ..
this means that these projects have so far not helped in improving the point of view of popular public opinion and that of the radical movements in the " vast middle east " towards washington and its policies in the region ..
decisions of georgia and istanbul summits
it might still be premature to expect washington to finally relinquish its great project -- adopted as well by the group of eight at the georgia summit and the atlantic alliance summit in istanbul in 2004 -- which aims at repeating the eastern europe scenario in the arab islamic world ..
but many indications reveal the reluctance of many american and european decision makers to keep on supporting the " democratic reform " project ..
if such democracy will produce forces hostile to the strategic interests of washington and its allies in the region ..
and in the whole world ..
starting with israel 's interests ..
if this reluctance continues , washington 's priority , and that of its allies will again be security and military , and not political ..
despite the frequent declarations made by president bush junior and his former secretary of state , colin powell , and his current secretary of state , condoleezza rice , which express the belief that among the reasons for the prominence of terrorist movements antagonistic to america and the west is its support over the past 60 years for the security option at the expense of freedom and democracy ..
on energy control and supporting new energy : generating electricity with nuclear energy among most important mid - and long - term energy solutions ; studying possible solutions for preventing external attacks on electricity and gas network
tunis - morning - mr. othman ben arfa , ceo of the societe tunisienne d ' electricite et de gaz , said that for the mid - term and the long - term -- that is , within the next two decades -- our country needs to generate and produce electricity through investment in nuclear energy , which is considered to be among the best alternative energy solutions , is not
expensive , and is currently available , in light of the increased cost of fuel all over the world .
at a presentation about the company 's strategy for ensuring the country 's energy needs before members of the parliamentary economic and financial committee , with representatives from the national agency for energy control in attendance , the ceo of steg declared yesterday at the corporate headquarters in the capital , that soon , and at the highest level , a study will be made of the possible solutions for dealing with the problem of the recurring external attacks on the company 's electricity and gas network that cost millions of dinars in annual losses , and are the cause of 50% of electrical failures in greater tunis .
at this meeting which was attended by mr. ezzeddin khalafallah , general manager of the national energy agency , mr. othman ben arfa highlighted steg 's future programs in the field of electric and gas energy production , and also discussed numerous issues related to services offered to customers .
in his speech about available future possibilities in the field of alternative energy , he said that in addition to more work to exploit solar power and wind power , nuclear energy is considered the most important alternative energy that can be used to produce electricity , particularly since the tunisian electricity network is capable of absorbing and transferring the huge electrical power that can be produced by nuclear energy .
he explained that with regard to this tunisia had submitted its application on the subject of nuclear energy utilization for peaceful uses to the head of the international atomic energy agency during his earlier visit to our country .
in the presentation devoted to the company 's future programs , it was mentioned that during 2005 steg was able to achieve a total energy savings equivalent to about 156,600 tons of petroleum , worth 29 million dinars .
during the next phase , work will be done to extend the natural gas network to new areas and connect 50,000 new subscribers to the network . this will be done within the framework of a program that will be implemented from 2005 to 2009 to raise the number of subscribers to the network to more than 400,000 , which will make it possible to save government subsidies of about 92 million dinars .
the company will also work in the future to reduce the import of gas packaged in cylinders by expanding the gabes gas production and transfer plant , which will provide an annual profit of about 15 million dinars . it will improve quality and billing services based on the latest technologies such as the internet and monthly deductions to pay for consumption , in which 70,000 subscribers are currently enrolled , or by means of pre - paid cards on which reliance may increase in the future .
saving 1.25 million petroleum - equivalent tons
the most prominent aspect in the presentation submitted by the general manager of the national agency for energy control was the content of the three - part program for energy control during the 2005-2008 period through which a total energy savings of about 1.25 million petroleum - equivalent tons will be achieved , and state subsidies of 220 million dinars will be avoided in exchange for a 70 million dinars account balance .
with regard to heating water with solar energy , in 2005 22,000 square meters were installed , and five suppliers and 237 installation companies in the field were authorized . this will make it possible to attain total savings of 1600 pet annually , and avoid government subsidies of about 516,000 dinars annually .
during the same period , 84 natural gas companies were connected , which will make it possible to replace a total of 100,000 pet annually of subsidized petroleum products , and avoid government subsidies of about 7.6 million dinars annually .
by 2008 , 220,000 homes are scheduled to be connected to the natural gas network , and the use of energy - saving equipment will be universally available with the installation of about 8,000 voltage regulators in the old lighting networks , which will make it possible to save 30% of the total annual cost of consumption for municipalities , or about 7 million dinars annually .
an energy control program will be made universally available for all electrical household appliances , starting with refrigerators , and the sale of the types that consume the most energy -- categories 8 , 7 , 6 , and 5 -- will gradually be prohibited .
with regard to the utilization of wind energy , 160 megawatts will be installed by steg through the phase one expansion of the wind station at sidi daoud .
in the field of scientific research , eight research projects have been developed in the field of energy control with the participation of 20 laboratories , 12 organizations , and 200 researchers from various scientific research institutions .
energy - saving lamps month
through the same program , three million energy - saving lamps will be installed from 2005 to 2008 , which will make it possible to save 136 pet of energy and avoid subsidies of 12 million dinars . so far one international request for proposal for the acquisition of two million lamps has been sent out , with the possibility of supplying the market through the local industry with about 400,000 lamps each month for a price of not more than 4,500 millimes per lamp .
with regard to recent developments in awareness and sensitivity , the energy - saving lamps month has been organized to run from the 10th to the 10th of next march . it will have a multimedia advertising campaign promoting locally manufactured energy - saving lamps , and setting a uniform price to the public in all areas ranging from 2,860 millimes to 4,445 millimes , depending on the brand . it is expected that 400,000 lamps will be provided during the campaign .
during the current year , television , radio , newspaper , and field campaigns will be continued , along with organizing six sector - related seminars in cooperation with the concerned ministries .
it is noteworthy that the meeting included a thorough discussion between the committee members , steg officials , and the national agency for energy control . there was an opportunity for the delegates to make some inquiries and suggestions , and a number of them expressed their admiration for the important data presented by the two giants on the future programs in the field of energy control .
in particular , the development which steg is witnessing on all levels has made it a shining pioneer both locally and internationally .
it is also noteworthy in the same context that 43 of steg 's branches all over the republic will soon get international certification for quality .

this year 's food trade balance : towards achieving 197 million dinars surplus
tunisia -- morning -- preliminary expectations for this year 's food trade balance indicate that exports will increase by 15.6% to reach 1,187 million dinars compared to 1,027 million dinars for 2005 , according to the economic balance sheet for farming and sea fishing for 2006 , thereby achieving a surplus of 197 million dinars of exports over imports .
this improvement is mainly due to the expected increase in exports of olive oil that are expected to reach about 600 million dinars this year compared to 476 million dinars last year , an increase of 26% .
as far as all other products are concerned , compared with last year their revenues are expected to increase from 13% for prunes , since the french market absorbs the bulk of the exported quantities , or 99.8% .
in the same context 241 tons of prunes were exported last year for the first time .
this is in addition to the positive development which the date sector is expected to witness this year , 4.4% , taking into account that last year 's date exports amounted to 45,000 tons with a value of 114 million dinars .
exports of seafood products are also expected to witness this year an increase of 2.9% to reach 18,500 tons . it should be noted that 18,000 tons of seafood products with a value of 175 million dinars were exported in 2005 .
with regard to imports , this year is expected to see stability in their total value of about 990 million dinars , which is almost the same as in 2005 at around 992 million dinars .
the value of grain imports is expected to record an increase of 13% to 439 million dinars , compared to 338 million dinars last year . this is due to reduction in production in this area to 1.8 million tons after registering 2.1 million tons last year , according to the economic balance sheet , while imports of other products will register a reduction according to the same source .

chinese law protects women 's rights / fifth supplement
abortion also remains a thorny issue for lawmakers .
selective abortion of female fetuses and female infanticide are prohibited in the draft amendment to address the gender imbalance of newborns in china .
the ratio is 100 female babies to 117 male babies , according to china 's fifth national census of 2004 .
yet some legal experts are unwilling to take legal action against such abortions , believing women should have freedom of choice in childbearing .
dr. xia says ,
" it is urgent to deal with this discrepancy , but selective abortion cannot be controlled without blanket restrictions on all conditions , as there is no way to prove why a woman decides to have an abortion . "
beyond academic circles , the draft amendment also raises concern in public opinion .
yan xiaoxing , a 50 year old nanjing employee , thinks that the society has provided many opportunities for women in the past decades and women 's social status should be raised a lot .
she says , " the key issue is that we as women should broaden our horizons ourselves , and we should study hard to be more knowledgeable , and we should increase our awareness of gender equality and self - confidence as well . "
" if you are not ready and competitive , no one is to blame but yourself . "

russian legislator expresses his concern and urges calm regarding controversy over cartoons
moscow , february 6th , xinhua -- a senior russian legislator expressed his concern regarding the publication of cartoons of the prophet muhammad .
today , monday , he urged calm in the midst of the increasing controversy over the drawings .
the interfax news agency mentioned that konstantÃ­n kosachiov , head of the foreign affairs committee in the russian parliament , the duma , said , " we are concerned about the european actions , not just in their initial stage when a news organization in one of those countries published the cartoons , but also about the actions that followed -- the republication of these drawings in several other european countries . "
12 of the cartoons that denigrate the prophet muhammad which were published by a danish newspaper last september and republished in other european countries caused disturbances in the islamic world .
this is because any depiction of the prophet , whether negatively or positively , is considered blasphemy by most muslims .
the cartoons sparked violent protests in syria and lebanon . angry demonstrators set fire to the danish and norwegian embassies in their countries .
last week the danish newspaper 's editor in chief issued an apology to the furious muslims after refusing to do so for a long time , insisting on the right of freedom of expression .
kosachiov said , " following the apologies , the international community must respond forcefully to the violence . " he demanded an immediate end to it .

egyptian people 's assembly approves postponement of local council elections
cairo , february 14th , xinhua -- an egyptian parliamentary source stated today , wednesday , that the egyptian people 's assembly yesterday , tuesday evening , passed a draft law submitted by egyptian president hosni mubarak to postpone the elections of local councils for two years .
the same source , who belongs to the governing national democratic party , told the xinhua agency in cairo that during the session held yesterday evening , tuesday , the people 's assembly passed the draft law extending the terms of office of the existing local councils for two years . this means the de facto postponement of elections that should have been held over the coming two months .
the source also said that the assembly had witnessed heated discussions among mps of the muslim brothers , the official opposition parties , and some independents who opposed the draft law on one side , and the governing national democratic party mps on the other side .
he pointed out that the proposal to maintain the local public councils for two years in addition to their current term was considered in order to hold elections for these councils according to the new vision adopted by the local administration system specified in the new law that satisfies the requirements of the constitutional amendment targeted by the program of egyptian president hosni mubarak .
he added that if these elections were held now according to the existing local administrative law , the councils resulting from these elections would not be in conformity with the new visions and provisions incorporated in the new local administrative law supporting the local administration and enhancing their executive and supervisory powers .
the source asserted that the proposal for the two - year postponement conforms with an important practical consideration which is as follows : if the local public council elections were postponed for only one year , they would coincide with the mid - term shura council elections , for which procedures start in april 2007 . practical considerations require that it be avoided . based on the foregoing , the draft law was prepared so that the existing local public councils will continue for two consecutive years beyond their current term .
the egyptian shura council also approved the postponement of local elections two days ago .
it should be noted that the terms of office of the currently existing local councils in egypt would have ended next april 15th . according to the law , the elections of the local councils should have been held during the 60 days preceding the end of their term of office .
the opposition parties and political powers in egypt reject the decision of the shura council approving the law on postponement of the elections , accusing the governing national democratic party of trying to prevent them from running for elections and marginalizes their role in the local arena .

the sources further said that rice 's talks in the region will focus on the developments of the peace process in the middle east after the victory of the hamas movement in the palestinian elections , especially since hamas so far does not have a clear position regarding the continuation of the peace process with israel .
the sources noted that during her visit rice will confirm the position of the united states supporting the establishment of a palestinian state , provided that hamas recognizes israel , renounces violence , and disarms its militias .
the sources added that rice will discuss with the leaders of the region the developments in the iranian nuclear file and methods of resisting iran 's influence in the region .

at a press conference held today , wednesday , qaradaghi said that " president talabani is meeting with all the major political factions , listens to their points of view , and is seeking to move their positions closer together in his capacity as the president of the republic and the sponsor of the political process in the country , in addition to being the president of the kurdistan coalition bloc . "
qaradaghi pointed out that all parliamentary blocs are talking about national agreement and are stressing that there are no red lines against any list that has won in the elections . he described this position as " a good step " and said that president talabani was pleased with it .
he further stated " the president made it absolutely clear that he did not accept the matter of red lines . even if someone is mentioning them , that does not mean that all the members of the bloc to which he belongs have the same opinion . furthermore , al-sayyid al-hakim denied the existence of any red lines against the participation of any bloc in the next government . "
regarding the form of the new government , qaradaghi said that " the political situation in the country is unique . iraq is still in a state of war against terrorism , not to mention the poor economic situation and regional and international changes . this necessitates relying on a formula of agreement in running the country , taking into consideration the outcome of the elections . " he further emphasized that talabani is calling for putting the principle of agreement above the narrow interests of the parties .
he reported that the leaders of the political blocs have not yet reached the point of discussing the details of the formation of the coming government , which must be a true national unity government that includes every one , and there must be no red lines against any bloc . in the meantime , it is important to reach an agreement on a clear political program that the next government will adhere to .
erekat sends urgent letters to international community to stop israel 's plans
gaza , february 16th , xinhua -- saeb erekat , the palestine liberation organization 's chief of negotiations , today , thursday , sent urgent letters to a number of countries requesting immediate intervention to stop israeli plans to isolate the al-aghwar territory and divide the west bank .
a statement issued by the department to xinhua said that the letters were sent to u.s. assistant secretary of state david welch , the representative of the un secretary general , alvaro de soto , the european representative for the peace process , marc otte , the russian representative for the peace process , alexander kalugin , and several ambassadors , consuls , and representatives of the european union , latin america , asia , africa , canada , australia , and japan .
the statement noted that the letters stressed that " the continuation of attacks means dropping the choice of peace and making impossible the establishment of a palestinian state with the june 4 , 1967 borders . furthermore , they are part of the policy of imposing facts and dictates on the ground instead of negotiations . "
the statement stressed that " isolating the al-aghwar area means paving the way for its annexation to israel . such a decision constitutes a real human catastrophe because it will prevent two million palestinians from entering the region which comprises one third of the total area of the west bank . "
the statement added that " the completion of the expansion wall and the annexation have created a racist system in the west bank . the annexation of east jerusalem , the isolation of al-aghwar , the increasing settlement activities , and the continued confiscation of water reservoirs mean that the israeli government is implementing the long term interim phase plan or the state with temporary borders in return for a long term truce . "
the statement warned that " the implementation of these plans means a human , agricultural , educational , and health catastrophe for all inhabitants of the al-aghwar area . the israeli settlers , who number 8,000 , have taken control of all the water in the al-aghwar area as well as most of the agricultural land . they have also established industrial colonial housing complexes related to livestock . "
