roed - larsen : the middle east is " a powder keg with a lit fuse . "
oslo , february 6 ( a.f.p. ) - terje roed - larsen , the former un envoy to the middle east , considered that the situation in that region was never at the level of danger in which it is today , and compared the region to " a powder keg with a lit fuse . "
speaking to the norwegian public radio " nrk " , roed - larsen said : " in a lot of respects , the region now can be compared to a powder keg with a lit fuse . "
and he added : " i think that the situation is more difficult , more complicated and more dangerous than it has been in many decades . "
among the current and latent crises in the middle east , roed - larsen mentioned the arab - israeli conflict , the iranian nuclear issue and the crisis between lebanon and syria .
he said : " all this brings us back to issues of fundamental values and opinions that make the situation more vulnerable to getting out of control at any moment than it has in recent days . "
roed - larsen did not explicitly mention the acts of violence that occurred during demonstrations in the islamic world in protest against the publication in european newspapers of cartoons about the prophet mohammad , but only emphasized the necessity of " dialogue " instead of " throwing stones and lighting fires . "
demonstrators burned the two buildings of the danish and norwegian embassies in damascus on saturday , whereas a building housing an office of the danish embassy in beirut was burned , in reaction to the publication in september of drawings in the danish daily jyllands - posten and their subsequent re - publication in a number of european media channels led by the norwegian magazine " magasinet . "
roed - larsen is currently in charge of monitoring the implementation of united nations security council resolution 1559 that stipulates the disarming of militias and armed groups in lebanon , including , according to that international organization , the lebanese shiite hezbollah and palestinian groups .

jerusalem 2-7 ( afp ) - the chief of the israeli domestic security services ( shin bet ) yuval diskin warned of the danger of " jewish terrorism " during a meeting with young settlers in the west bank that was carried by channel two of the israeli television monday evening .
diskin declared to the students of a religious college for paramilitary training , " i say it to you in all honesty , if a jew carries out a terrorist operation , he is considered a cancer in the state and constitutes a much greater danger than hamas , " in reference to the islamic resistance movement .
diskin made these statements about a month earlier but his speech , which was recorded a month ago , was not broadcast until monday evening by the israeli channel ten .
he added , " i assure you that we will pursue with the same severity a jewish terrorist who kills arabs or an arab who kills jews . " but he admitted that the arab receives " a harsher treatment than what a jew receives for perpetrating the same acts . "
he expressed his grave concern at " the extremist tendency " in the circles of young settlers who are driven to violence in expressing their opposition to dismantling the settlements .
on the other hand , diskin considered that the collapse of the regime of iraqi president saddam hussein was at the end of the day " harmful to israel " because " chaos has spread throughout iraq . "
tens of thousands of settlers and supporters of the extreme right demonstrated sunday evening in west jerusalem under the slogan " olmert is harmful to jews " in reference to the acting prime minister .
and they wrote on one of the placards , " olmert is leading us to civil war " in reference to the demolition of nine houses built in the illegal amona settlement near ramallah in the west bank .

hamas rejects what parties within fatah consider to be exposing the palestinian national plan to danger
by taher al-majzoub
( a re - run with clarification in paragraph 4 )
ramallah ( the west bank ) 2-8 ( afp ) - some leaders in the fatah movement have expressed their fear that the palestinian national plan might be endangered when the islamic resistance movement hamas of the palestinian authority takes power , but the islamic movement strongly rejected this proposal .
adnan al-damiri , one of the leaders of fatah in the west bank affirmed to agence france presse that " hamas as a part of the worldwide moslem brotherhood movement is not concerned with the regional issue of the palestinian state as much as it is concerned with the international issue of islam . "
and he said , " the other aspect is that hamas is a resistance movement that can be compared with the taliban and chechen movements , and this is a characteristic that distinguishes it from the rest of the islamic movements in the arab and islamic world , but hamas has not executed operations outside the borders of palestine . "
al-damiri , who ran as a candidate for the fatah movement in the last elections and did not win , felt that the difference between hamas and fatah is that " fatah has a program that calls for seeking through negotiations to establish a palestinian state in the west bank and gaza , with its capital east jerusalem , on the basis of the 1967 borders , and that fatah considers this solution to be strategic , whereas hamas sees it as provisional . "
in the same vein , a palestinian official who refused to disclose his identity asserted that hamas " belongs to the islamic tide that does not care for the establishment of a regional state as much as it cares for setting up the islamic caliphate , and as such its interests may intersect with tehran and damascus , and it is a candidate for an alliance with hezbollah in lebanon and iran and the moslem brotherhood in any country in the world . "
he added , " even syria may use it in the context of a continuation of its policy aiming at trying to exploit the palestinian and lebanese causes as a card to pressure israel , particularly since the baath party also considers the regional issue a secondary one relative to arab nationalism . "
consequently , if hamas agrees to a truce with israel for a period of ten or 15 years , it might retreat on the issue of liberation and focus on imposing the islamic project on society , as he said .
more than one official in hamas has affirmed that the islamic movement , which is preparing to form the new palestinian government , is ready to enter into a long term truce with israel .
in a conversation with france presse , parliament representative for hamas , mahmoud al-rimhi , vehemently denied that hamas is jeopardizing the palestinian national plan .
he said , " this is a claim with no basis in truth . israel 's unilateral policy started before hamas won , and this was when the fatah movement was in power because oslo ( agreements ) ( 1994 ) did not specify when settlement activity will end , nor borders for the palestinian state . " as a result , the movement has no responsibility in jeopardizing the palestinian plan .
he also added that israel decided within the same unilateral policy " to withdraw from the gaza strip and build the separation wall before hamas ' victory and even before a date for the legislative elections was designated , and before hamas ' decision to participate in them , " asserting that " israel does not respect any of the agreements made , and negotiations did not stop this . the only solution is to continue the resistance . "
the chief of the political bureau of the hamas movement , khaled meshaal , announced today , wednesday , that the movement could commit to " a long truce " with israel if it withdraws to the 1967 borders and " recognized palestinian rights . "
al-rimhi said , " the truce with its conditions , which are the establishment of a palestinian state within the 1967 borders , including east jerusalem and releasing the detainees , " affirming , " if we cannot achieve those conditions and if israel does not release any prisoner and does not withdraw from the west bank , then hamas will be released from the pacification it agreed to in the cairo agreement . "
ahmad saadat , the secretary general of the popular front for the liberation of palestine , told france presse from his prison in jericho , " we have no fear that any palestinian party will abandon the palestinian plan because the battle is fundamentally with the israeli occupation , and we have not heard from the hamas movement any abandonment of the principles of the palestinian cause under any banner or program . "
he affirmed that " the attachment to these principles and the resistance to the occupation are common denominators , " and " the resistance is tied to the existence of the occupation . "
saadat added , " we are awaiting what hamas will offer , and what is required from all the forces of the palestinian society is a democratic vision and an internal concordance as a first part in the election of the members of the legislative council . the second part should be reflected in the participation of our citizens abroad through direct voting . "
it is to be noted that both the popular front and hamas reject the oslo agreements and the roadmap plan .
similarly , bassam al-salehi , parliament representative for the parliamentary alternative bloc ( people 's party - left ) , said , " it is premature to draw general or hasty conclusions for several reasons , including that hamas ' victory does not necessarily mean political imbalance in an absolute manner . "
rather , he called for " looking again at the results because support for hamas in the palestinian street does not exceed half the voters , 40% , " adding , " i think that the program of the liberation organization , independence , international legitimacy and the arab peace initiative , has the majority in the palestinian street . "
al-salehi said , " it is difficult for any political movement to reach agreements on less than this program . "
al-salehi pointed out that his bloc " is thinking of proposing a draft resolution in the legislative council or in the central council of the liberation organization for declaring the 1967 borders as the borders of the palestinian state , with its capital jerusalem , and demands the world to recognize this ( . . . ) because the issue of the borders is not subject to negotiations , but a subject for conflict . "
al-salehi affirmed , " now we believe that the priority task is to rebuild the palestinian democratic trend on clearer foundations in both its political and social arenas , and the basis is the independence document , because it defines a social vision for the political system that is based on a secular system . "
suzuki will soon announce its future in the world rally championship
tokyo 2-8 ( afp ) - the japanese company suzuki said that it will soon announce its plans to participate in the world rally championship or not , without disclosing the details related to this matter .
david farquhar , the media official and head of the public relations department in the japanese company , announced that the announcement will be made on the sidelines of the geneva automobile show at the end of this month .
several leaders of the world rally championship are discussing that suzuki may join the family of official manufacturers beginning next year , since it currently participates in the category " junior wrc " aboard swift s1600 . it garnered the title of the swedish rally phase i of the championship of that category , and the second phase of the wrc championship with its swedish driver per - gunnar andersson .
suzuki participated in many rallies outside the two categories in what constitutes a preparation for the possibility of its officially joining the senior category in the world championship . reinforcing these expectations is its announcement today that it will make its decision on this matter on the 28th of this month ( 2:00 geneva time ) .
if it decides to participate , this will constitute great support for the championship , particularly with the withdrawal of the french companies citroen , the world champion for the past three years , and peugeot , japanese mitsubishi , czech skoda and korean hyundai at the level of official participation .
citroen will return to the championship next year with a new car , c4 , instead of xsara , although it is offering a semi - official backing for the belgian company kronos racing ( citroen xsara ) and its two drivers , the frenchman sebastien loeb , world champion for the past two years , and his spanish colleague xavier pons . it is also supporting his fellow citizen daniel sordo , champion of the " junior wrc " last year who is following the footsteps of loeb himself who was crowned champion of this category before he moved on to the senior category .
the number of official manufacturers in the championship , if suzuki participates and citroen returns next year will increase to four , with subaru and ford , which won the first two phases of the championship of this year with its new finnish driver marcus groenholm . the other participations within the " special category " are limited , as is the case with the finn toni gardemeister ( astra racing - peugeot 307 ) who missed the swedish rally after achieving third position in monaco , frenchman gilles banitzi ( red bull - skoda ) , and italian gigi galli who is participating at his own private expense ( mitsubishi lancer w , version 2005 . )
israeli minister considers putin 's invitation to hamas " a stab in the back "
jerusalem 2-10 ( afp ) - the israeli minister of education , meir shitrit , said today , friday , that the invitation by russian president vladimir putin to hamas leaders to visit moscow is " a real stab in the back to israel . "
the minister said in a statement to israel public radio , " this initiative is a real stab in the back ( . . . ) because its purpose is to give international legitimacy to a terrorist group , and we must oppose it by all means . "
the minister continued , " what will moscow say if we issue an invitation to the representatives of the chechens to visit jerusalem ? "
shitrit added , " russia , which prevents the holding of free elections in chechnya , cannot be giving us moral lessons about the legitimacy of hamas after the elections . "
for his part , housing minister zeev boim said in a press statement that " putin is playing with fire , " and that he considers russia 's position " very worrisome . "
a senior israeli official had expressed since thursday evening israel 's strong resentment for the latest russian position , and said , " when the chechens carry out an attack in moscow , russia considers it a terrorist act , but it is a different matter when it happens in jerusalem , " in reference to tens of suicide operations that hamas executed over a period of ten years .
putin announced on thursday from madrid that he will " soon " invite hamas officials to moscow to hold discussions about the future of the peace process between israel and the palestinians .
putin , whose country does not classify hamas among the " terrorist organizations , " recently said that the european union is committing " a serious mistake " in case it decides to suspend financial assistance to the palestinians .
the russian president emphasized that hamas arrived to power after democratic elections , and " the choice of the palestinian people ought to be respected . "
modifications in the al-otari government and al-sharaa is vice - president in charge of foreign affairs
by nassib azar
damascus 2-11 ( afp ) - syrian president bashar al-assad issued today , saturday , three presidential decrees making a ministerial change that brings 14 new ministers into the government . they particularly made changes in the posts pertaining to foreign affairs , in conjunction with the campaign of external pressures which syria has been enduring for more than a year .
according to the first decree , foreign minister farouq al-sharaa has been appointed " vice - president in charge of implementing foreign and information policy . "
the second decree makes changes in the government of mohammad naji al-otari , according to which 14 new ministers join the government in sensitive posts such as foreign affairs , the interior and information . according to the decree , walid al-mouallem has been appointed foreign minister after having been deputy to foreign minister farouq al-sharaa .
as to the third decree , it calls for appointing syria 's representative to the united nations , faysal al-miqdad , as deputy foreign minister to succeed al-mouallem .
the ministerial shuffle did not affect the post of prime minister which remains under the presidency of mohammad naji al-otari , whereas major general bassam abdel - majid was appointed minister of the interior to replace ghazi kanaan who committed suicide on the 12th of last october .
major general abdel - majid has been commander of the military police in syria since 2002 , and prior to that he was in charge at the intelligence services for the southern region of syria . he was born in quneitra in 1950 .
at the ministry of information , mahdi dakhlallah was dismissed and replaced by mohsen bilal , who was syria 's ambassador in spain for many years . he is an instructor at damascus university .
sufian allaou was appointed minister of petroleum and mineral resources to succeed ibrahim haddad , and ghayath barakat minister of higher education to succeed hani murtada .
minister of defense hassan turkomani remains at his post , and similarly for butheina shaaban the minister of emigrants , mohammad al-hussein the finance minister and amer hosni lotfi the minister of economy and commerce .
joseph soueid was appointed minister of state , and he is the first member of the social national syrian party to be appointed as minister since the party joined the national front in 2005 .
the baath party obtained the lion 's share of the government as it received 19 ministries , including the prime minister 's post , while seven ministers were appointed from seven parties represented in the progressive national front , to which seven independent ministers were added .
the progressive national front comprises a group of ten parties led by the baath party .
the custom has been that each of the nine parties in the national front , except the baath party , gets represented by a minister in the government , but the present ministerial change removed two parties from the representation , which are the arab socialist union party led by safwan qodsi , and the movement of the socialist unionists led by ghassan abdel aziz othman .
the other parties in the front were represented by six ministers of state , whereas the communist party received the ministry of irrigation represented by youssef al-faysal ,
this ministerial change was not unexpected since discussions about it have been ongoing since the suicide of the interior minister ghazi kanaan , whose post became vacant with his death on the 12th of this past october .
these ministerial changes coincide with a campaign of international pressures that syria is exposed to , due to the investigation into the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri , with two reports by the international inquiry commission pointing to the involvement of the lebanese and syrian security services in the assassination incident .
also , the united states has accused syria of facilitating the entry of arab fighters into iraq through syrian territories .

the yemeni authorities have launched a campaign for hunting down the fugitives and they have arrested 95 of their relatives in an attempt to force them to surrender .
the prisoners had escaped through a tunnel that is 44 meters long connecting their cells in the prison and a neighboring mosque . the diameter of the tunnel did not exceed 70 centimeters .
warships of the alliance led by the united states which patrol the territorial waters facing yemen participated in the search operation for the 23 fugitives , while the international police " interpol " issued an international warning about their escape .
yemen is the country where the family of osama bin laden , the leader of the al-qaeda organization that claimed responsibility for the attack , has its roots .
since the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the united states , yemen has worked with washington on curbing those who are suspected of being supporters of al-qaeda organization in yemen .
elsewhere , the yemeni court today , saturday , rejected the appeals request that was presented by three prisoners from the al-qaeda members , one of them is among the fugitives from the prison who was convicted of planning to launch attacks against western targets in the gulf countries .

the director of samarra hospital clarified that " this information is absolutely unfounded . "
the first case of death with bird flu was registered in iraqi kurdistan where two persons died from bird flu at sulaymaniyah hospital ( 330 km . north of baghdad . )
one person also died in al-amara ( 265 km . south of baghdad ) with symptoms of the influenza disease , but the results of the laboratory test on blood samples from muhannad radi ( 30 years old ) , who was fond of raising birds , have not come out yet .
burning of ten churches in ten days in the american state of alabama
birmingham ( the united states ) 2-13 ( afp ) - ten churches were burned in ten days in the state of alabama in the south of the united states , and the police suspect two men without knowing the motives for carrying out these actions that are a reminder of former racist practices .
the latest criminal act on saturday consisted in the burning of the beaverton freewill baptist church , at a distance of 145 km . northwest of the city of birmingham .
the authorities announced that it is too early to immediately make a link between previous arson operations and this tenth incident of its kind .
these operations did not cause casualties but they did cause considerable damage .
this series of incidents began with the burning of five churches in bibb county on the third of february .
four days later , four other churches were burned in three neighboring counties in western alabama .
the police , who have much evidence , are searching for two white individuals in their twenties or thirties and a blue - colored car that was spotted near the churches .
the police have announced a reward of 20,000 dollars to anyone who takes part in the arrest of the sinners .
investigators can only guess at present the motives of the perpetrators of these actions , and they think that the perpetrators are trying to draw the attention of the media .
in the fifties and sixties of the last century , several churches that were frequented by blacks in the state of alabama were targeted .
the wave of burning of churches frequented by a majority of blacks goes back to the two years of 1995 and 1996 , when more than 30 religious buildings were set on fire in tennessee , louisiana , alabama and south carolina .

baghdad 2-13 ( afp ) - the former iraqi president saddam hussein and his seven aides today , monday , caused a state of chaos during the 11th session of their trial by swearing at and interrupting the judge , whom they accused of bringing them to the courtroom against their will , in the absence of their defense team .
saddam hussein entered the courtroom wearing a blue - colored robe and a black vest . during his entry he repeated , " down with the traitors , down with the traitors , down with bush , long live the nation , long live the nation , long live the nation . "
the former president told the judge that he was forced to enter the courtroom .
this was followed by a state of chaos since the accused objected to their being brought forcibly into the room . ibrahim barzan al-tikriti , saddam hussein 's half - brother , shouted in the direction of the judge rauf rashid abdel rahman , " you are very far from mercy and these names . you are neither mahmoud , nor rauf . you are a military tribune and not a judge . we do not want to sit here in this place . "
and he added , " i cannot continue this session in the absence of my lawyer . "
he continued saying that he was afflicted " with an incurable disease and medical tests have been done on me by the americans in the american compound , which is why you have to set me free so i can receive the treatment . the law stipulates the necessity to release any accused who is afflicted with an incurable disease . i am dying gradually . you are killing me . "
and when the judge told him that the court agreed to present him to a medical panel , he said , " if you fear god , release me so i can receive the treatment with my family around me , and i will sign any pledge that i will attend the sessions . i have a case of honor and i want to defend my honor . "
he continued , " but if you think that the baath party needs me , then know that the baath party works well and does not need me or anyone else , and this is its secretary general ( he points with his finger towards saddam hussein ) . he has been two years in jail , so set me free for the purpose of receiving treatment . "
the judge answered , " you have talked a lot and have taken a lot of the court 's time . " but barzan interrupted him saying , " i have the right to talk until tomorrow . "
after that , barzan al-tikriti noticed that the judge was ignoring his demands to be released , so he left his seat , sat on the floor and turned his back towards the judge , ignoring the trial session .
and saddam , who appeared angry as he carried the qur'an in his hand , cursed the judge for forcing him to attend the session . and he said , " this is the custom of traitors , god is greatest and let the despicable be driven away . may god curse your mustache . "
he added , " this is not a court ; this is a game . "
saddam told the judge , " you have no right to appoint lawyers for us instead of our lawyers , with my respect to them , because they have agreed to defend us , and my respect to every iraqi . "
the judge explained that " the court has appointed substitute attorneys for the defense team according to iraqi law , after the defense lawyers boycotted the session . " but saddam replied to him , " they did not boycott the sessions . rather , it was you who expelled them , and in fact some of them were beaten up in front of you . "
judge abdel - rahman replied , " i do not permit you to discuss political matters . "
but saddam interrupted him , " you are an ignorant . what politics ? you operate selectively and against the law . "
then the prosecution began reading the testimonies of many witnesses who spoke about what they were subjected to at the hands of the security services after his arrest in 1982 .
saddam hussein intervened in protest . and he said to the president of the court , " when the witnesses discuss politics , that is allowed , but when saddam hussein and his comrades discuss political matters , then this is forbidden . "
saddam hussein and his former aides , and the defense panel , boycotted the tenth session of the trial which was convened on the eighth of this february after they withdrew from a preceding session , after a heated argument with the new judge who assumed the presidency of the special court , rauf rashid abdel rahman .
attorney khalil al-dulaimi , head of saddam hussein 's defense panel , announced to agence france presse on sunday in a telephone communication , " in my capacity as head of the defense panel team , i can confirm that no one from the defense team and not one of the accused will attend today 's trial session . "
jaafar al-moussaoui , the public prosecutor of the court , had declared that " the court will convene a meeting prior to the trial session to look into the possibility of bringing the accused by force or leaving them on their own if they insist on not attending . "
he noted that " in case the court makes any decision , it must be implemented irrespective of the nature of that decision . "
saddam and his aides are on trial since last october in the case of the killing of 148 villagers in the shiite town of dujail in reaction to an attack that targeted the convoy of the former iraqi president during his visit to the village in 1982 .

jeddah ( saudi arabia ) 2-13 ( afp ) - the high representative for foreign policy of the european union , javier solana , carried a message of " respect " to the islamic world whereas the secretary general of the organization of the islamic conference , ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , called on europeans to adopt legislation to combat hostility toward islam . "
the meeting between the two men was held at the headquarters of the organization of the islamic conference in jeddah on the red sea , in the midst of a crisis resulting from the publication in european newspapers of caricature cartoons of the prophet mohammad , which moslems considered offensive .
solana said after the meeting , " with regards to the european union , we have profound respect for moslems ( . . . ) and we never wanted to hurt their feelings , " asserting that " this was never our intention and will never be so at any time . "
he noted that he conveyed this message to ihsanoglu by telephone , but insisted on conveying it to him in person as well .
for his part , ihsanoglu emphasized the necessity for the europeans to adopt legislation through the european parliament to fight hostility toward islam .
oglu said , " unfortunately what is happening today ( . . ) is that the islamic world has begun to feel a new september 11 directed against it , " in reference to the attacks that struck the united states in 2001 .
ihsanoglu called for including a principle mandating the necessity of respecting all religions and prohibiting their defamation in the founding statute of the new human rights council presently being established .
solana avoided responding directly to the question of enacting legislations of this kind . but he said that he does not see " any difficulty in approving such a provision if it were part of the foundations of the human rights council that is presently being established . "
this council will replace the current commission which is headquartered in geneva and whose prestige and credibility have fallen greatly after it was shown that its operating methods allowed countries not committed to human rights to be represented among its ranks .
solana had announced on wednesday that he will visit " a number of countries " in the region , including saudi arabia , in order to calm the anger that has spread over the islamic world as a result of the publication of these cartoons .
according to the program of the visit , solana goes after this meeting to riyadh where he meets the saudi foreign minister prince saud al-faysal and king abdullah bin abdulaziz .
after saudi arabia , solana goes to egypt , where he meets president hosni mubarak and the secretary general of the league of arab states amr moussa , and after that to jordan , and he will end his tour in the palestinian territories and israel .
the secretary general of the arab league , amr moussa , had called in an address at the jeddah economic forum on sunday to extinguish " the evil spark " that was caused by the crisis of the publication of cartoons that are offensive to the prophet mohammad , rejecting a return to " the crusades . "
moussa said , " this era is not appropriate for a conflict between east and west . let us put our hands , we the moslems who are desirous of a positive relationship , in the hands of our brothers in europe and america who share such an opinion with us , and they are many , to extinguish this evil spark . "
and he added , " let us put this matter behind our backs and work together , us and them , to prevent a repetition of this . "
the cartoons that are offensive to the prophet mohammad were published for the first time in a danish newspaper last september before they were published in several other european newspapers in the name of freedom of expression .
the region was the scene of a boycott of danish products and violent protest demonstrations in the arab and islamic world that caused several deaths and injuries .
each of saudi arabia , libya and syria recalled their ambassadors from denmark .
and denmark withdrew its ambassadors from syria , iran and indonesia , fearing for their safety .

mofaz accuses hezbollah of seeking to ignite the northern front of israel
cairo 2-14 ( afp ) - israeli defense minister shaul mofaz today , tuesday , accused the lebanese shiite hezbollah of seeking to ignite the northern front of israel " with support from syria and iran . "
mofaz told journalists at the conclusion of a meeting with egyptian president hosni mubarak in cairo that " hezbollah uses lebanese territory as a base for its terrorist activities against israel . "
and he added , " we know that syria and iran support hezbollah and their objective is to divert the attention of the international family away from syria to the lebanese - israeli borders . "
and he said that syria is subjected to american and western pressures " because it supports terrorism and finances it . "
he clarified that he informed mubarak of the latest operation that hezbollah carried out on the borders , noting that " it is trying to kidnap israeli soldiers . "
the israeli minister said that " the objective of hezbollah , which is supported by syria and iran , is to open a second front against israel . "

iran confirms its resumption of uranium enrichment process ( collected news )
by siavosh ghazi
tehran 2-14 ( afp ) - tehran confirmed today , tuesday , the resumption of the uranium enrichment process at the natanz plant , refusing to suspend " its research " in this field , while western countries made a condition of stopping this process before resuming negotiations with tehran over tehran 's nuclear program .
javad vaeedi , a member of the supreme national security council and in charge of the nuclear issue , announced that " activities have started " at the uranium enrichment plant in natanz ( central ) .
tehran had announced on monday the removal of the seals and the dismantling of the surveillance cameras belonging to the international atomic energy agency at the natanz plant .
diplomatic sources in vienna , the headquarters of the international atomic energy agency , had announced that iran has resumed enrichment activities at that site .
but vaeedi refused to comment on statements saying that the iranians started the enrichment process itself by pumping uranium hexafluoride gas into the centrifuges .
he told journalists after an address he delivered before an islamic association of tehran students , " i cannot answer you regarding these technical issues . " he asserted that " it is unacceptable that we stop our research , " noting that " the core of the nuclear program is the enrichment " of uranium .
the resumption of the enrichment process itself had caused the cessation of dialogue with the europeans last august , then again in january after its resumption in december .
those countries adopted on february 4th a decision at the international atomic energy agency in which they asked iran to suspend all its sensitive activities and notified the international security council of the iranian issue .
but tehran , instead of complying , responded by announcing the end of the advanced monitoring regime that is conducted by the international atomic energy agency on its nuclear program , and the resumption of all activities that were suspended , particularly those associated with large - scale enrichment .
the natanz plant comprises two enrichment units , one is a project that focuses on research , and the other consists of an industrial scale facility that is being completed .
and about this unit , vaeedi said that iran " needs time for its industrial capability to be complete with about 60,000 centrifuges ( to enrich uranium ) but we have started our activities . " he clarified that his country does not see " any reason at the present time to return to a suspension " of its activities at that site .
vaeedi justified the series of unilateral initiatives that his country undertook since " the europeans , after they displayed good intentions during the past three years , they requested a complete abandonment of the nuclear fuel cycle . "
the europeans especially refuse that iran conducts uranium enrichment on its territory because they consider that this country has not yet proven that its nuclear program is purely civilian .
the enrichment process is considered essential for obtaining fuel for nuclear stations , but it can also be used to manufacture nuclear weapon materials .
it is expected that the international atomic energy agency reconvenes a meeting on march 6th to determine whether iran has complied with its demands and most likely to decide to refer the issue to the international security council .
in the meantime , an iranian delegation will be visiting moscow on february 20th , as vaeedi said , to discuss russia 's proposal to enrich the iranian uranium on its territory .
but this proposal is contingent on the position of the iranians who are conducting the enrichment process on their territory , which is what the western countries do not accept .
a german islamic institute calls on ahmadinejad to visit auschwitz
( return to qatar )
berlin 2-14 ( afp ) - a german institute of moslems monday evening criticized the iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad for his statements about the jewish holocaust during world war ii , calling on the iranian president to visit the auschwitz site by himself " if he has the courage for it . "
a spokesman for the institute " institut islam - archiv - deutschland " told the german catholic news agency ( kna ) that " in this terrifying place he can again deny the jewish holocaust if he has the courage for it . "
the spokesman added that ahmadinejad , by denying the holocaust , he not only denigrates the memory of the jews who were victims of the holocaust , but he also harms the memory of about 200,000 gypsies and arabs who were killed in the " gypsy camp " in auschwitz - birkenau and other detention camps .
he continued that the adoption by the president of an islamic state of nazi anti - semitism was " a disgrace on all the world 's moslems . "
the " institut islam - archiv - deutschland " institute , which was founded in 1927 , is the oldest islamic association in germany .
it seeks to protect the archives of the islamic community since the 18th century , and to encourage dialogue between the moslems of germany and the other religious denominations .

by nasser abu - bakr
ramallah ( the west bank ) 2-15 ( afp ) - the executive committee of the palestine liberation organization said today , wednesday , that the israeli expansion of settlements undermines the chances of achieving peace in the region , affirming its complete commitment to all agreements signed with the government of israel under international sponsorship .
the statement of the executive committee at the conclusion of today 's meeting at the presidential headquarters in ramallah under the chairmanship of the president of the palestinian authority mahmoud abbas , a copy of which was obtained by agence france presse , said " the executive committee discussed the settlement onslaught that is targeting the al-aghwar region in an israeli attempt at isolating this region from the rest of the palestinian territories in the west bank under obvious security and expansionist pretexts . "
it affirmed " its categorical rejection of these settlement plans that tear our palestinian land into isolated cantons to prevent our people from establishing their independent state . "
the statement added , " and the executive committee addressed itself to the quartet committee that issued the roadmap to declare its position toward this rampant settlement over our land and the necessity for it to play its role which it assumes regarding the peace process and the solution of ( establishing ) the two states . "
it continued that " the continuation of settlement in holy jerusalem , the racist wall of separation , the isolation of the al-aghwar region in an attempt at its judaization , and the crimes of assassinations , invasions and arrests , they destroy any opportunity for achieving a just and permanent peace in the middle east . "
it added , " it was decided to hold a meeting of the high committee under the chairmanship of salim al-zaanoun ( abul - adib ) , speaker of the national council , in the city of ramallah during this week to discuss the ongoing preparations for convening the palestinian central council and to approve plans and decisions which are being prepared by the high committee to activate the organization , the executive committee and the specialized departments . "
the statement said that the committee " discussed the next meeting of the palestinian legislative council scheduled for saturday , " confirming " the complete adherence to the national principles that were approved by the successive palestinian national councils , and also the commitment to the political program of the palestine liberation organization and the declaration of independence of 1988 . "
it affirmed " the complete commitment to all political agreements that were signed with the government of israel under international sponsorship , and also the adherence to the resolutions of international legitimacy pertaining to the palestinian cause , especially resolution 194 which deals with the right of return of the palestinian refugees and the decisions of the arab summit in beirut . "
the statement noted that " all palestinian institutions must exercise their political and national roles , foremost of which are the legislative and executive institutions , in protecting the national gains , the international recognition of the organization , the authority , and the highest interests of our people . "
saleh ra'fat , member of the executive committee of the palestine liberation organization , said in a statement to agence france presse , " the committee has decided to begin a broad diplomatic campaign at both the arab and international levels , including the security council , the quartet committee and the contracting states in the geneva agreements in order to confront the israeli policy aiming at annexing the settlement blocks and al-aghwar region and at a unilateral delineation of the borders . "
he added , " the executive committee has confirmed that the members of the new legislative council are members of the national council , and with this the hamas movement enters the palestinian national council which is considered the parliament of the liberation organization , which makes it eligible to also participate in all the institutions of the organization that the hamas movement had reservations about joining . "
he continued , " the executive committee discussed the speech of president abbas that he will deliver at the inauguration ceremony of the legislative council next saturday . "
ra'fat said that the speech " will affirm the adherence to the political line of the liberation organization and will point out that any palestinian prime minister will be charged , will abide by the resolutions of the palestinian , arab and international legitimacies . "
rice admits mistakes the american administration made in rebuilding iraq
washington 2-16 ( afp ) - the american secretary of state condoleezza rice today , thursday , during a hearing session in congress , had to admit some mistakes made by the american administration in the area of rebuilding iraq .
after kent conrad , the democratic senator for the state of north dakota , showered her with questions about the results of the reconstruction programs for which the united states spent more than $ 20 billion , rice had to admit two mistakes on the part of the american administration , one related to the training of iraqi forces and the other to the infrastructure .
the secretary , who was testifying before the budget committee in the senate , said that the strength of the iraqi security services has now reached 227,000 men .
and she clarified , " to be honest , we made a mistake in the beginning since we relied on quantity and not on quality . the troops existing at present are qualified . "
and in her talk about the united states " developing a large part of the infrastructure , " particularly at the level of drinking water and water purification , rice admitted under the pressure of the questions of the senator that the number of iraqis who have drinking water and a sewer system is less than what it was before the war .
and she added , " you are right , we concentrated our efforts on consolidating the capabilities to provide those services , " and not on the hauling and purification grids of local water .
and conrad answered her by saying , " we can improve the capabilities and that is very good , but what matters to people at the end of the day is obtaining these services . "
strange laws gives peculiarity to england
by jalal malti
london 2-17 ( afp ) - england has a set of old laws and customs , some of which are strange and some are funny , that are still in force though not enforced , but which certainly amuse law students with their peculiarity .
one of these laws is a law from 1279 which states that " it is not permissible for members of parliament to wear a shield " inside parliament , and the purpose of this law was to prevent fights and quarrels leading to killing between lords in a country with deep - rooted democratic traditions .
and among these strange laws is also a law that prohibits members of parliament from dying inside westminster castle and that , if happens , the body must be transferred outside parliament before a death certificate is issued .
nigel cawthorne , author of a book entitled , " the strange laws of old england , " that reviews these amazing texts which time has bypassed , explains that that law is attributed to the fact that " westminster castle is a royal castle and anyone who dies in a royal castle is entitled to an official funeral . "
also , members of parliament have the right to gamble and drink alcohol freely in westminster , including at the library , whereas their compatriots suffer a fine for the similar behavior according to the library trespasses act ( 1898 ) .
there are still in england more than 4,000 national laws , 11,000 local laws , 13,000 special laws that date back to before 1801 and which are still in force .
cawthorne told agence france presse that " the tradition of law is very important " in england , explaining that " things change , but very slowly and ( the laws ) are added to each other . "
the fact is that members of parliament legislated in many facets of everyday life , including the very ordinary aspects of it , and in the 19th century at the height of the industrial revolution they issued a number laws with the objective of regulating life in the suburbs .
this eagerness led , for example , to the prohibition of hanging laundry in the streets or singing lewd songs , shooting with a firearm without justification , starting a fire in the park , playing with paper planes , skating on ice , bothering residents by knocking on their doors without justification , lighting public lights " willfully and illegally , " and other laws that are laughable in our day .
some of these laws have not been enforced for a long time because of the progress that occurred since they were issued , and one of the most peculiar ones is a law that prohibits riding a horse or a cow or riding a steam automobile in a state of drunkenness ( 1872 ) .
and a law dating back to 1867 prohibits anyone " living at a distance of less than a mile from a weapons or explosives depot " from acquiring a paper doll , while a law issued in 1839 stipulates a punishment for anyone firing a canon near a house .
kevin martin , the president of the legal society mandated with suggesting laws that ought to be eliminated , said that " these unusual examples represent the old history of the tradition of the law in this country , and they confirm the continuous need to renew the law and adapt it to reality . "
more than 2,000 texts of law have been eliminated since 1965 in a large operation to modernize the laws .
however , british members of parliament insist on issuing strange laws such as the " outer space law " ( 1986 ) which prohibits any british citizen from " throwing a body in space " without official permission , defining space as including " the moon and all the celestial bodies . "
and wisdom has dictated on them to authorize judges to issue orders " for the use of a reasonable amount of force " to repeal a possible invasion by space beings .
sunni imam warns against celebrating valentine 's day
baghdad 2-17 ( afp ) - three days after the passing of valentine 's day , a sunni imam launched in his friday sermon an attack on valentine 's day and those who celebrate it in iraq , charging that it " takes the youth out of virtue and into vice . "
most imams of the mosques in iraq focused today , friday , in their sermons on the photos of abuse of detainees which date back to 2004 , whereas some others concentrated on the poor services and the security situation difficulties in the country . however , sheikh mahmoud al-sumaidiee , imam of the umm al-qura mosque , focused on valentine 's day , which is celebrated worldwide on the 14th of this month , and considered that it has no relation to islam .
he said , " the international valentine 's day passed two or three days ago , and unfortunately , many of our young men and women do on that day what delights our enemy . they exchange gifts and exchange words , and it has reached the point of exchanging kisses . this is what our enemies want for us , that we live far away from virtue . "
valentine 's day is a very popular day in iraq , as it is in the other countries of the world . young men exchange with their girlfriends sweets , flowers , perfumes and other gifts .
al-sumaidiee added that " every invasion has objectives , and the invasion of our country wants to trap our youth and take them out of virtue and into vice . "
the history of the celebration of this occasion in iraq goes back to before the american invasion in 2003 . there was a big celebration that was held on the occasion during the era of the regime of deposed iraqi president saddam hussein , and official television used to present special programs for the occasion .
it is noteworthy that the son of the iraqi president uday was known to hold huge parties on the occasion of valentine 's day in the halls of the hunting club in the upscale al-mansour neighborhood , and they lasted until the early morning hours .
al-sumaidiee said that " international valentine 's day is not looked at well by islam , and moslems ought to live with their religion . "
berlusconi signs political agreement with radical right in italy
rome 2-17 ( afp ) - the italian prime minister silvio berlusconi signed today , friday , seven weeks before the legislative elections , a political agreement with the neo - fascist movement " social alternative " that is headed by alessandra mussolini , the grand - daughter of the italian dictator benito mussolini .
berlusconi announced in the presence of mussolini , " we have reached an agreement on the program between ' house of freedoms ' ( the ruling coalition ) and the social alternative " , thus expanding his electoral alliance to the radical right .
the alliance with social alternative , in preparation for the voting operation scheduled for the ninth and tenth of april , provoked the anger of the rest of berlusconi 's allies because of the presence of controversial personalities affiliated with the neo - fascist radical right in this formation .
berlusconi asserted , " our family photo album is ideal , it is snow - white . "
a solution was reached when mussolini and her two uncomfortable allies , roberto fiori , leader of forza nuova ( new force ) and adriano tilgher , leader of the national social front , decided on thursday not to personally run as candidates on the lists of the house of freedoms coalition and suggested other candidacies .
massimo dalema , leader of the leftist democrats ( the largest opposition party ) , said today , friday , " that it is a very dangerous thing that berlusconi signs agreements with the neo - fascist radical right . "
ignazio la russa , leader of the members of parliament of the national alliance ( right - wing conservative , originating from the movement that succeeded fascism ) , the second party in berlusconi 's coalition , emphasized that in spite of the withdrawal of the leaders of social alternative from candidacy , " the fundamental problem continues to consist of sharing basic values and the political program . "
mussolini 's party calls for rejecting turkey 's joining the european union , rejecting european arrest warrants and abortion laws , and it calls for deporting immigrants and signing a new treaty with the catholic church , and it denounces " american imperialism . "
moslems as primary victims of terrorism practiced in the name of islam ( belgian study )
brussels 2-17 ( afp ) - a new study conducted by belgian researchers and entitled " progress of terrorism in 2005 " reports that moslems are the primary victims of the terrorism that is carried out in the name of islam , and that international terrorism strikes the middle east more than it strikes the west .
on the other hand , the study noted that 90% of victims of international terrorism in 2005 died in iraq and jordan .
this study was conducted under the chairmanship of rick kohlsaat , professor of international relations at the university of ghent in western belgium and was published on the government 's " economie " site on the internet .
according to the study , the number of international terrorism operations has dropped greatly in 2005 compared with 2004 , as there were 266 attacks that killed 443 victims in 2004 , compared to 393 attacks that killed 733 victims in 2005 .
the study considered that terrorism is not a danger of a global nature , because it is primarily concentrated in one region which is the middle east .
in contrast , " local " terrorism , that is the one perpetrated by the subjects of a state against targets in their own country witnessed a large increase between 2004 and 2005 , since the number of attacks rose by 90% while the number of victims rose by 60% .
the study concluded that this increase is almost completely the result of the situation in iraq .
it also said that " the conflict in iraq , which was presented as an element in the war on terrorism , contributed to making iraq today a center of terrorism . "
rick kohlsaat , relying on these numbers , said in a telephone communication with him , " imagine how the islamic world looks at these numbers , when the western party insists on saying that it is the one threatened " by terrorism .
the study uncovered that " the notion that says that international terrorism represents a fundamental external threat is not supported by the facts . "
in the same context , kohlsaat said that " jihadist terrorism does not represent this existential threat that we believe it is , even if it represents a challenge to our society . "
this study , which is the second of its kind , relied on data obtained from the famous american institution " rand corporation " , and from the national memorial institute for the prevention of terrorism and from its special database on terrorism .
berlusconi faces difficulty in dismissing minister accused of insulting islam
by christian spielmann
rome 2-18 ( afp ) - italian prime minister silvio berlusconi today , saturday , waged a battle with his allies of the northern league in order to dismiss one of their leaders , who is the reforms minister roberto calderoli , with the goal of calming the tension in the islamic world caused by his statements that are injurious to islam .
the prime minister asked calderoli to resign , stressing at the same time today , saturday , that he " has no authority to force him " to do so .
the minister concerned replied saying he is ready to resign in " case ( umberto ) bossi ( leader of the northern league ) asks me to do that and in case the islamic world undertakes an initiative of pacification . "
the italian minister is accused of insulting islam by wearing a cotton shirt bearing the caricature cartoons that are insulting to the prophet mohammad which caused a serious international crisis . he was wearing the cotton shirt on thursday and he appeared wearing it during the evening newscast on the italian channel one " rai . "
this initiative by him and other new accusations against islam he made in press statements on friday led to violent anti - italian demonstrations in libya in which ten people were killed on friday .
roberto calderoli does not intend to apologize . the newspaper " corriere della sera " quoted him today , saturday , as saying , " i do n't feel responsible for those deaths . "
in his statement to the newspaper " la republica , " he emphasized that " western culture is the one threatened . "
silvio berlusconi had caused a shock in the islamic world when he asserted " the superiority of western culture " on september 26 , 2001 , two weeks after the attacks on the united states . he faced great difficulties to repair the repercussions from those statements .
calderoli ( 49 years old ) , who is a former physician specializing in - maxillofacial surgery , is considered one of the radicals in the northern league , the movement that is anti - foreigners and is allied with berlusconi .
he joined the government in july 2004 to replace bossi , the leader of the league who was forced to resign after he suffered a heart attack . the league assumes three ministries , which are justice , labor and reforms .
roberto calderoli affirms that he has the support of umberto bossi and his party , in addition to " the support of the many italians who think like me . "
he said , bragging to la republica newspaper , " silvio berlusconi asked for my resignation , but i have not resigned yet . "
italian authorities fear new demonstrations today , saturday , against italy in the islamic world , in addition to reactions in italy .
berlusconi announced that he has asked the interior minister giuseppe pisano to ensure the surveillance of the offices of the northern league , and he confirmed that " all protection measures have been taken to ensure the safety of italian missions abroad . "
as for the italian foreign minister gianfranco fini , he declared his determination to visit the rome mosque today , saturday , in an attempt to calm the tension that was stirred by calderoli 's statements .
this is not the time that the prime minister is in a confrontation with the northern league over the demand for the resignation of one of its ministers from the government .
in july 2003 , he had to negotiate with umberto bossi to dismiss the deputy minister of tourism stefano stefani who made statements that were offensive to german tourists .
the confrontation lasted one week and caused a crisis in the diplomatic relations with germany that was already upset at the insults directed by silvio berlusconi personally to a german representative , whom he compared to a nazi concentration camp guard .
this new crisis comes at a critical phase for the prime minister who is immersed in a difficult campaign as part of the legislative elections scheduled for the ninth and tenth of april . maurizio gaspari , one of the leaders of the national coalition ( right ) said that the crisis " came at a time we had begun to improve our position according to the opinion polls . "

with the news : solana between his mind and his heart , by nureddine ashoor
the tour taken currently by the foreign policy coordinator of the european union , javier solana , does not pose the question of the possibilities of its success as much as it begs the question of whether he appealed to his mind or to his heart when he volunteered to try and calm the mind of the islamic public opinion in the aftermath of the publication by many european newspapers of the cartoons that are offensive to the messenger .
and since solana is currently present in the middle east , it seems that he appealed to his heart after he was offended by the publication of the cartoons and he felt what moslems feel as a result of the insult that they received in the name of freedom of expression , since he did not hesitate to declare that " in the european union , we have deep respect for moslems ..
and we never wanted to hurt their feelings .. "
this is some of what the european official said after his recent meeting with the secretary general of the islamic conference organization .
and if the coordinator of european foreign policy had chosen ( and that is simply an assumption ) to listen to his mind , he would have spared himself the hardship of going to the middle east , either to apologize or to " convince , " and the crisis would have been resolved in a european context since denmark is a member of the european union and its economic interests are threatened with harm ..
so is it reasonable that a certain party hurries to the one unjustly treated to calm him and soothe him before condemning the oppressor and making him understand that what he did is rejected ?
was hitler left alone during world war ii , free and unencumbered to implement his aggressive plans and his racist ideas so the allies would be content with consoling the european peoples , including the jews ?
the most dangerous thing in this issue is that there are attempts to convince moslems of the soundness of the european conduct which still has not eliminated the pretext of freedom of expression in the context of the publication of the cartoons , for this does not solve the crisis . there are some who paid the price of their lives in protesting the cartoons , and as such europe would have succeeded in achieving two things . the first is to dilute the issue and keep it in the context of freedom of publication , and the second is to export the crisis to islamic countries where it would be reduced to a situation of chaos and violence .
for this reason , the mere transformation of solana to a man of good offices towards the islamic world shows that the european union did not comprehend the feelings of moslems who do not deny the freedom of expression , but they do n't want it to be a tool to incite hatred and violate religious feelings ...
when we hear about the issuance of a european , then an international law that criminalizes attacks against religions and harming the sacred , then solana 's efforts will truly be praiseworthy .
lakhdar ibrahimi and the mandela of iraq , by assia al-atrous
because acknowledging failure and admitting defeat never did find their way easily into the lexicon of international diplomacy in general , and arab diplomacy in particular , especially when the matter relates to the war on iraq or the events , circumstances , and mysteries that surrounded it and surround it , which may not be exposed for a long time , the words that came out of the mouth of the cunning algerian diplomat lakhdar ibrahimi about his impossible mission in iraq cannot pass without drawing attention or giving pause for thought .
and because lakhdar ibrahimi was practically the only arab and maghrebi diplomat who accepted to enter into the adventure up close and carry out a mission that was not free of danger , either personally or as a journey , by going to an arab country after it had been occupied and destroyed , it is therefore very natural , in the midst of the dangerous developments the iraqi scene experienced over the past two and a half years , that his mission would arouse a great deal of debate about the causes and the motives that could induce a man of ibrahimi 's stature and experience to accept being involved in a role under the direction of the american occupation , since he had been very clear in his positions from the start , and since he had no qualms admitting that the decision for war was made outside the framework of international legitimacy . lakhdar ibrahimi had previously linked the success of his mission in south africa during the apartheid to the existence of a leader like mandela who was able to establish the committee for truth and reconciliation and rally his people around him , it seemed virtually impossible a few years ago to achieve a dream that was ...
and without doubt , when ibrahimi , the former advisor to the secretary general of the united nations , and who embodies a journey that cannot be underestimated in various areas of diplomatic work and efforts exerted in many crises in the developing world , returns and admits the failure of his mission , and determines the causes and the kinds of mistakes which he fell into , besides all kinds of convulsions and fatal deception , he has thereby removed the mantle of the stubborn and tenacious diplomat who knows he is wrong but refuses to admit it and insists on proceeding on the wrong track because his pride and sense of honor prevent him from doing so , in spite of his conviction about what the consequences and risks could be to him ...
.
in an interview he gave to one of the arab newspapers , ibrahimi admitted his failure in his mission in iraq , which he described as impossible in light of all kinds of vetoes he faced during the discharge of his mission . ibrahimi , who used to and continues to bear the title of the man for difficult missions , did not deny feeling embarrassed for accepting to participate in working with the occupation authorities in iraq and under those thorny circumstances , considering at the same time that what motivated him to accept this mission was the assurance of the american administration that it seeks to end the occupation as soon as possible , which was not true after it became clear that all that mattered to the american administration was not to search for a solution to the present situation in iraq as much as it was to search for a solution to the problem it created for itself in iraq , particularly with regard to the american public opinion that had realized that the reasons used by the white house administration to justify the war were fictitious and based on false reports ...
perhaps the reasons that drove ibrahimi to acknowledge his failure do not stop at one specific reason , but they remain linked to a series of reasons , the most important of which is that he realized that the occupation was bringing resistance and resistance was bringing repression , torture and secret prisons , and that it is impossible in any case for the military option to be the required solution in iraq ...
ibrahimi 's confessions reflected a present reality in iraq for the past several months , not in the amount of material losses and the impact of demolition and destruction , but more importantly in the amount of human losses , the psychological wounds , alienation and displacement , while the absence of a national figure that is influential and capable of gathering the ranks of iraqis and unifying them remains a critical factor in helping to get out of the present situation and overcome the various challenges of the coming phase ..
is it then possible , after the long suffering of iraqis , to reconsider the faulty policy in iraq in order to salvage what can be salvaged and give iraqis an opportunity to recover their sovereignty , far from any kind of custodianship and solutions imported in the cans of democracy .
news analysis : after hamas ' victory and its alliance with damascus , tehran and moscow : will washington retreat on its political projects in the arab world ?
by : kamal ben younes
tunis - al-sabah . pressures mounted on the american administration - after the victory of hamas with a majority in the palestinian parliamentary elections - to convince it to abandon its projects that call for political and economic reform in the greater middle east - i.e. in the arab islamic world from morocco to indonesia - so that the " radical movement " of the enemies of washington and the west not benefit from those elections ..
particularly since all american opinion polls
and european predict an increase in the feelings of opposition to the politics of the united states and the atlantic capitals from arab and islamic public opinion because of the two wars in afghanistan and iraq , and the bias of the american administration and most western governments towards the sharon government throughout its campaign of repression of the palestinian people and their leadership throughout the past five years ..
and according to the british newspaper financial times , the administration of the american president george bush " is currently reconsidering its declared plans for spreading democracy in the middle east region after the crushing victory of the islamic movement hamas in the latest palestinian legislative elections . "
the newspaper reported that the neo - conservatives close to the american president have begun reviewing their plans to spread democracy in the middle east after the sweeping victory of the hamas movement .
it added that since the results of those elections appeared , there is " a flood of reports and studies pouring on the bush administration advising it to exercise caution and slow down on the issue of spreading democracy in the middle east . "
stop pressuring the regimes
similarly , several recommendations were issued by conservative research centers and think tanks that support the republican administration in the white house urging it to " not put pressure on the arab regimes " and stop supporting the " tendency to impose the model of spreading democracy in eastern europe on the countries of the islamic region . "
the adherents of the position that is against the democratization of the arab islamic region link the victory of hamas and the electoral gains garnered by the extremist wing in the elections of iran with the victory of the candidates of the moslem brotherhood organization with five seats in parliament for the first time in egypt ..
security and military alliance
according to the financial times and many european and american sources , " in spite of the criticisms directed by the administration at the egyptian regime because of its violations of the law during the latest legislative elections , " the american budget of 2007 anticipates an increase in the volume of military and security assistance that washington provides to cairo since it is " an important ally in the war on terrorism .. "
which means that the priority for washington and its european allies will be security and not politics .
alliance of hamas with washington 's opponents
this debate that will continue in the european and american media is intensified by many issues , of which :
* the support by some countries which washington and some european capitals consider to be major opponents , to hamas ( and its upcoming government ) , particularly syria , iran , sudan , russia and venezuela , and the list could extend to include other countries such as cuba , korea , china and several arab and islamic countries ..
* the objective alliance between tehran , moscow , beijing and many of the countries of europe and the asian countries against the option of a siege of iran because of the iranian nuclear issue ..
tehran 's foreign policy after the victory of ahmadinejad and the weakening of the moderate reformist movement under the leadership of mohammad khatami and his former minister of education mahajerani ..
* the failure of the majority of washington 's liberal and secular allies in iraqi elections ..
and the centering of the conflict in the elections , the political game and the security battles between sunni , shiite and kurdish movements , parties and groups that have many contradictions , the vast majority of which have a religious character .
.. and do not distinguish between religion and politics
* the persistence of the security unrest and the waves of suicide attacks against american and allied forces in iraq and afghanistan ( thousands of dead and wounded americans in 2005 alone ) , and against israeli targets in occupied palestine ..
in spite of the projects in support of reform and democracy that have been adopted by the administration of president bush for years ..
which means that those projects have not yet helped to improve the general opinion among the people and the radical movements in " the greater middle east " of washington and its policies in the region .
the resolutions of the georgia and istanbul summits
it may be premature to expect a final retreat by washington from its great project - which was adopted by the group of eight also at the georgia summit and the atlantic alliance in istanbul in 2004 - and which aims at repeating the eastern european scenario in the arab islamic world ..
but many indicators show a great hesitation by american and european decision makers to continue supporting the " democratic reform " project ..
if this democracy will spawn forces that are hostile to the strategic interests of washington and its allies in the region ..
and in the world ..
beginning with the interests of israel ..
and if this hesitation continues , the priority of washington and its allies will again be military security and not politics .
in spite of public statements that were repeatedly issued by president bush the son and his two secretaries of state , the former , colin powell , and the current , rice , which considered that one of the reasons for the emergence of terrorist movements hostile to america and the west is their support for the past 60 years of the security option at the expense of freedoms and democracy .

tunis - al-sabah . mr. othman ben arfa , chief executive officer of the tunisian electricity and gas company , said that our country needs for the medium - and long - term , i.e. during the next two decades , to generate and produce electricity by investing in nuclear energy , which is considered one of the best alternative energy solutions that is not
expensive and available at the present time in light of the rising cost of fuel in the world .
and the chief executive officer of the steg reported at the occasion of his presentation of a review of the company 's strategy in the area of providing the energy needed by the country for the benefit of the members of the economic and finance committee of the parliament , in the presence of representatives from the national agency for energy control yesterday at its headquarters in the capital , that there will be soon and at the highest level an investigation of the possible solutions to confront with determination the problem of the repeated external attacks on the electric and gas grid of the company , which is costing annual losses estimated in the millions of dinars and which represents 50% of the electricity breakdowns in greater tunis .

the company in the future will also shrink its imports of gas bottles by expanding the gabes plant for producing and converting gas , which will enable an annual profit close to 15 million dinars , and improve quality and billing services by relying on the most modern technological methods such as the internet and the technique of a monthly deduction in the amount of the consumption for which there are currently 70,000 subscribers or by using pre - paid cards that may be adopted more widely in the future .
saving 1.25 million ton equivalents of oil
as to the review that was presented by the executive director of the national agency for energy control , its highlights included presenting the contents of the three - year program for energy control 2005-2008 through which will be achieved an overall savings of energy of about 1.25 million ton - equivalents of oil , and avoiding a state subsidy of a value of 220 million dinars , in exchange for a credit appropriation estimated at 70 million dinars .
concerning heating water with solar energy , 22,000 square meters were installed , five suppliers in the sector and 237 installation companies were approved , which will enable the achievement of overall savings close to 1,600 ton - equivalents of oil annually and avoid an annual state subsidy of 516,000 dinars .
during the same period , 84 institutions were connected to natural gas , which will enable an overall substitution close to 100,000 ton - equivalents of oil annually of subsidized petroleum substances and avoid an annual state subsidy close to 7.6 million dinars .
by 2008 , 220,000 residences are scheduled to be connected to the natural gas grid , and disseminate the usage of energy - saving equipment by installing approximately 8,000 pressure controls in the old lighting grids , which will enable to save energy at 30% of the cost of the annual consumption of municipalities , which is equivalent to seven million dinars annually .
disseminating energy control programs to all household electrical appliances beginning with freezers , such that the promotion of those with the highest energy consumption will be banned gradually from category eight and seven , then six and five .
regarding the exploitation of wind energy , 160 megawatts will be installed throughout the steg by expanding in the first phase the wind station in sidi daoud .
in the area of scientific research , eight contract research projects have been developed in the area of energy control with the participation of 20 laboratories , 12 institutions and 200 researchers from various scientific research institutions .
energy saving light bulb month
within the same program , three million energy - saving light bulbs will be installed between 2005 and 2008 , which will enable a savings in energy of 136,000 ton - equivalent of oil and avoid a subsidy of 12 million dinars . so far , an international call for bids has been sent for the acquisition of two million light bulbs , with the possibility of furnishing the market with local manufacturing by about 400,000 bulbs monthly at a price not exceeding 4,500 millimes per bulb .
as to developments in awareness and sensitivity , the organizing of the month of energy - saving bulbs was launched from ten to the tenth of next march , consisting in a multimedia advertisement campaign that promotes energy - saving light bulbs made locally , and adopting a unified retail sales price at the large department stores ranging between 2,860 millimes and 4,445 millimes based on the brand . it is expected that 400,000 bulbs will be provided during the campaign .
during the current year , television , radio , press and field campaigns will be ongoing , besides organizing six retail panels in cooperation with the relevant ministries .
it is noted that the meeting included ample discussion among committee members and officials at the steg and the national energy control agency . this was an opportunity for members of parliament to put forward some inquiries and suggestions , and several of them expressed their admiration for what was presented by both bodies in terms of the significant data covering the future programs in the area of energy control .
particularly , the steg has experienced progress at all levels , which made it a pioneer and a star at the national and international levels .
it is also of note in the same context that 43 branches of the steg that are located throughout all the regions of the republic will soon receive the international certification of quality .

the food trade balance this year : towards achieving a 197 million dollar surplus
tunis - al-sabah . early expectations for the food trade balance during 2005 indicate that the value of exports will grow by 15.6% to 1,187 million dinars compared to 1,027 million dinars achieved in 2005 , according to the economic trade for farming and fishing for 2006 , which will achieve a surplus of 197 million dinars so exports will exceed imports .
this improvement is fundamentally attributed to the growth anticipated for olive oil exports which are expected to amount to close to 600 million dinars this year versus 476 million dinars during the elapsed year , or an increase of 26% .
as for the rest of the products , it is expected that their revenues compared with the previous year will achieve an increase ranging between 13% for citrus fruits since the french market absorbs the majority of the quantities exported , or 99.8% .

chinese law protects women 's rights / fifth addition
abortion remains a thorny issue for legislators .
the selective abortion of the female fetus and the elimination of female newborns are banned in the draft amendment in order to deal with the imbalance in the gender of newborns in china .
the disparity in the ratio is at 100 females for every 117 males among babies according to the fifth chinese national census of 2004 .
in spite of that , some legal experts do not wish to take legal measures against these types of abortion given the conviction that women have the right to choose in reproduction .
dr. shia
says : " it is urgent to deal with this disparity , but selective abortion cannot be controlled without a set of restrictions applicable in all cases because there is no way to prove the reason why a woman decides to abort . "

oglu , the secretary general of the organization , expressed at the start his welcome to the european guest and his appreciation for the visit to the general secretariat of the organization under the present circumstances , in which the feelings of wrath and anger have been inflamed throughout the islamic world as a result of attempts by certain western newspapers to harm the sanctity of islam under the justification of freedom of expression , as reported by the saudi news agency this evening .
the secretary general expressed during the talks that he looked forward to the cooperation of the european union in order to get beyond this crisis and guarantee that it is not repeated .
for his part , solana emphasized that by coming for the first time to the headquarters of the islamic conference organization , he wanted to send the islamic public opinion a signal expressing the strong respect of europe for islam , and also affirming the respect by europe for the feelings of moslems . he also expressed his sadness and his regrets for the repercussions of the issue of the cartoons for which those responsible wrongly evaluated the feelings of the moslems regarding the cartoons .
solana said , " all this issue had no justification and we understand the reactions of moslems who felt grieved and prejudiced because of it , " stressing his genuine desire for cooperation with the islamic conference organization and the islamic states to avoid the occurrence of such an incident in the future .
he added , " today 's world is teeming with complicated crises and the last thing we want is a clash because of these cartoons . we are keen to work for cooperation in order to create a safe world , and we are talking to put in place measures that can calm the situation first , then look into conditions that guarantee that this incident wo n't happen again . "
solana noted the spirit of cooperation that he expressed and oglu submitted to him a number of legal and political recommendations that could lead to guaranteeing that this crisis wo n't happen again . these recommendations include the approval by the european union of legislative measures through the european parliament to confront the phenomenon of islamophobia in europe and exert joint islamic - european efforts to adopt a resolution at the general assembly of the united nations similar to the resolution that was recently approved under number 60 / 15 regarding the subject of " combating the distortion of the image of religions . " this prohibits offending all prophets or religions , and adopts a code of conduct by western media that takes into consideration the sensitivity of moslems and prohibits slandering all its expressions and manifestations and the fundamental beliefs of religions , including mocking the prophets . all of this should be considered a moral crime in the code of the western media , and the adoption by the united nations of an international system for the media that includes a definition of the extent of expression in the case of religious symbols within the framework of the unesco organization , and the inclusion of a clause in the resolution on freedom for the establishment of the new human rights council that prohibits harming religions . solana welcomed these ideas and promised to cooperate with the secretary general of the islamic conference organization , the european union and the organization of the united nations to implement them .

the deputy spokesman for the german foreign ministry , jens bluethner , said at a press conference , " if this news is true , then we regret this step , because it will mean that the time remaining for holding the next meeting of the board of governors of the international atomic energy agency next march will not be exploited as efficiently as possible in order to push in the direction of a diplomatic solution .

egyptian people 's assembly approves postponing elections for local councils
cairo , february 15 / xinhua / an egyptian parliamentary source today , wednesday , reported that the egyptian people 's assembly approved last tuesday night a draft bill presented by egyptian president hosni mubarak for postponing for two years the elections for local councils .
the same source , which is affiliated with the ruling national party , told xinhua in cairo that the people 's assembly approved by majority vote , during the session it held last night tuesday , the draft bill that calls for extending the term of the currently existing local councils for a period of two years , which essentially means the postponement of the elections that were supposed to be conducted over the next two months .
the source noted that the assembly was the scene of heated debates between the representatives of the moslem brotherhood , official opposition groups , and a number of independents who opposed the draft bill on one hand , and the representatives of the ruling national party on the other .
he indicated that the proposal was for the extension of the local councils for a period of two years . this period would be added to their current terms until elections for these councils are held in accordance with the new vision of the local administration system . this system was addressed in the texts of a new law that meets the requirements for a constitutional amendment which was the objective of president hosni mubarak 's program .
the source added that the holding of these elections now and under the existing local administration law would make the councils that result from these elections inconsistent with the improvements brought about by a new local administration law in terms of the vision and provisions supporting local administration and bolstering its executive and oversight jurisdictions .
the source noted that the proposal for postponement for a period of two years is consistent with an important practical consideration since the postponement for a period of one year would only make the elections of local councils coinciding with the half - term renewal elections for the advisory council , whose procedures begin in april 2007 . practical considerations require that this be avoided , and in implementation of the preceding , the accompanying draft bill was prepared to stipulate that the existing local councils will continue for a period of two years following their current term .
the egyptian advisory council approved the postponement of local elections two days ago .
the term of the current local councils in egypt was slated to end on the 15th of next april , as was stipulated by law that the elections of the local councils be conducted within the 60 days preceding the end of their term .
the opposition parties and political forces in egypt reject the decision of the advisory council to approve the law postponing the elections , and accuse the ruling democratic national party of seeking to prevent them from holding the elections and to marginalize their role at the local level .

the same sources told the xinhua agency that rice will hold talks in egypt with president hosni mubarak and senior egyptian officials on the developing situation in the region and the dossiers of the peace process , iraq , and iran .
the sources explained that the talks by rice in the region will focus on developments of the middle east peace process in the aftermath of the victory of the hamas movement in the palestinian elections , particularly since hamas does not have a clear position so far on the continuation of the peace process with israel .
the sources noted that rice will stress during the visit the position of the united states in support of the establishment of a palestinian state , but that it is important that hamas recognizes israel , renounces violence and disarms the militias that are affiliated with it .
the sources added that rice will discuss with the leaders of the region the developing situation with regard to the iranian nuclear dossier and the means to confront iran 's influence in the region .
rice had conducted a similar tour in the second half of last year during which she visited egypt and met with president hosni mubarak and a number of opposition leaders and intellectuals in egypt .

"
as to the shape of the next government , al-qaradaghi said , " the political situation in the country is of a special kind , since iraq remains in a state of war against terrorism , in addition to the bad economic situation and the regional and international changes . this requires the adoption of a consensus for managing the country , while taking into consideration the upcoming elections , " adding that talabani is calling for the consensus principle to override the parties ' narrow interests .
he reported that the leaders of the political blocs have not yet reached the phase of discussing details of the formation of the next government , which must be a true national unity government that includes everyone , with the necessity of not putting red lines against any bloc . it is critical at the present time to reach an agreement over a clear political program to which the next government will be committed .

the statement noted that the messages stressed that " the continuation of the practices and attacks means the cancellation of the peace option , and stands in the way of the establishment of a palestinian state along the borders of june 4 , 1967 , in addition to being part of the policy that imposes facts and dictates on the ground instead of negotiations . "
the statement stated " that isolating the al-aghwar region means paving the way for its annexation by israel , and this decision warns of a genuine human catastrophe since it will prevent two million palestinians from entering the region which is a third of the area of the west bank . "
the statement added that " completing the building of the wall of expansionism and annexation has created a racist system in the west bank , and the annexation of east jerusalem , the isolation of al-aghwar , the intensified settlement activities and the continuation of confiscating water reservoirs mean that the israeli government is executing a long - term transitional phase or a state with temporary borders in exchange for a long - term truce . "
the statement warned that " the implementation of these plans means a human , agricultural , educational and health catastrophe for all the residents of the al-aghwar region , since the israeli settlers , who number 8,000 settlers , now control all the water in the region of al-aghwar and most arable lands , in addition to the establishment of industrial settlement population centers , as well as those pertaining to the livestock .
