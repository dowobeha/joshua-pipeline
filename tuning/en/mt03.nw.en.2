puk announced that it took this step following threats from the ansar al-islam group , which controls a region where islamic law is enforced .
it is suspected that the group is associated with the al-qaeda network and the iraqi regime .
the information that has been circulating in recent weeks indicates that this group has carried out experiments with chemical weapons .
ansar al-islam , which is comprised of arab fighters who previously fought in afghanistan , is accused of launching a series of attacks against the puk , which has controlled part of iraqi kurdistan together with its opponent , the kurdish democratic party ( kdp ) , since the end of 1991 gulf war .

rafsanjani : american presence worse than saddam hussein 's weapons
tehran 7-2 ( afp ) - former iranian president , ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani , said friday that the american presence in the region is " worse than the weapons of mass destruction " of the iraqi president saddam hussein .
during the friday session in tehran , rafsanjani said , " the american presence in the gulf is worse than saddam hussein 's weapons of mass destruction . "
he added : " our position is clear : we strictly support the elimination of saddam hussein 's weapons , but also reject any kind of american presence in the region . "
the head of the committee to determine the expediency of the islamic order , the highest political dispute resolving authority in iran , condemned " the american pressures on countries in the region " in order to secure their full cooperation for a possible attack on iraq , and called for the elimination of iraqi weapons through the international security council .
rafsanjani accused the american president , george bush , of " waking up every morning with the intention of making a speech to terrify the peoples of the world . "
it is worth mentioning that iran , which had been at war with iraq for 8 years ( 1980-1988 ) , opposes an american war on iraq , whom america accuses of possessing weapons of mass destruction and links to terrorism .

the spokesman said , " the president will continue next week with his diplomatic efforts , hold meetings , make phone calls , and will meet the australian president , john howard , and the president of ecuador , lucio gutiérrez . "
bush declared on friday that un resolution 1441 is clear in requesting that iraqi president , saddam hussein , disarm . he reluctantly expressed his approval of a second resolution that would explicitly authorize a military intervention .
bush told reporters in the white house , " i have never believed that we needed a second resolution .
resolution number 1441 is self - explanatory .
it stipulates that there will be serious consequences if he ( saddam hussein ) does not disarm .
but as i said yesterday , it will be useful to have a second resolution issued , if it calls for respecting the resolution number 1441 and consolidates its spirit . "
the international security council had approved this resolution with full majority on the 8th of last november .
