erdogan confirms turkey will resist any pressure to recognize cyprus
ankara 12-1 ( afp ) - the turkish head of government , recep tayyip erdogan , announced today ( wednesday ) that ankara would resist any pressure the european union might exercise in order to force it into recognizing cyprus . this comes two weeks before a summit of european union heads of state and government , who will decide whether or not to open membership negotiations with ankara .
erdogan said to the ntv television channel : " the european union cannot engage with us through imposing new conditions on us with regard to cyprus .
we shall discuss this issue in the course of the membership negotiations . "
he added : " let me be clear - i cannot confine turkey . this is something we do not accept . "
it is expected that on the 14th december the european parliament will recommend that the heads of state and government of the european union agree to open membership negotiations with ankara , but on clearly defined conditions .
greece considers ankara 's recognition of cyprus , which has also become a member of the european union , to constitute " an a priori condition " for the european union to give the green light to opening membership negotiations with ankara .
turkey still refuses to recognize the republic of cyprus , which became a member of the european union on the first of may ; but it is the only state in the world to have recognized the " the turkish republic of north cyprus " which declared its own independence on the north of the island .
likewise , erdogan has refused the proposition of opening negotiations to create a privileged partnership between turkey and the european union as an alternative to membership negotiations .
on this subject , erdogan said that " this suggestion , which we cannot accept , is not worthy of a serious institution such as the european union " .
he added : " we want negotiations to begin in the first six months of 2005 , or in the second part of the year if that is not feasible ( . . ) but we cannot set a date to begin negotiations in 2006 " .

orejuela appeared calm while being escorted to the plane that would take him to miami , florida .
officials said they allowed him to call family members from the armored car he was in .
he was also examined by a police doctor .
colombian president alvaro uribe gave approval for the extradition on november 8.
the resolution that was signed by president alvaro uribe and interior and justice minister sabas pretelt stated colombia 's approval of extraditing rodriguez orejuela on charges of trafficking narcotics to the united states , distributing cocaine and money laundering through an international network of front companies .
the united states presented on december 1 two extradition requests for rodriguez , nicknamed " the chess player , " and his brother .
in florida and new york the two brothers face an indictment that alleges the import of cocaine into the united states , laundering hundreds of millions of dollars and the obstruction of justice from 1990 through july 2002 .
in florida , the drug enforcement administration refused to comment on colombia 's decision .

the agency stated that the king of bahrain met with king fahd bin abdul aziz and saudi crown prince abdullah ben abdul aziz . he held talks with the latter on " the outline of events in the gulf , arab , islamic and international arenas " . the situation in iraq and the latest developments in the palestinian issue topped the agenda .

the source denied that relations were lukewarm between the two countries .
the bahraini source asserted that the visit " falls within the framework of constant consultation and coordination between bahrain and saudi arabia , and there is no doubt that the gulf summit to be held in bahrain on december 20th will be on the agenda " .

us army deserter : army killed innocent civilians in iraq
toronto 12-8 ( afp ) a former us marine appeared yesterday as a witness to support claims by 26 - year - old jeremy hinzman , a us army deserter seeking refugee status in canada , and told immigration authorities how his platoon killed more than 30 iraqi civilians in just two days .
giving testimony before canada 's immigration and refugee board , set up to consider the merits of hinzman 's refugee claim that he fled because he refused to kill innocent civilians , sergeant jimmy massey said , " i do know that we killed innocent civilians " .
he added that in the spring of 2003 men under his command killed " more than 30 " civilians while on checkpoint duty in baghdad .
he told the tribunal that at the time , soldiers feared suicide bombings , so they would shoot at vehicles which ignored hand signals and one shot warnings at checkpoints .
he said that one time , after soldiers rained fire into four cars , searches found no evidence that those killed were anything but poor innocent civilians .
he also recalled watching soldiers kill four unarmed demonstrators and more iraqis the next day during a spell of checkpoint duty in the iraqi capital .
" when you do n't know who the enemy is , what are you doing there ? " asked jimmy massey , who after being diagnosed with post - traumatic stress and severe depression , was honorably discharged after 12 years ' service .
hinzman , who was in the 82nd airborne division and served in afghanistan , said that he realized after joining the army in 2001 that he was not capable of killing another person .
he fled to canada with his wife and son to claim asylum , and said he would face persecution if returned to the united states .
saddam hussein 's defense committee : red cross in geneva rejected meeting with committee 's delegation
amman 12-16 ( afp ) - the committee for the defense of the deposed iraqi president saddam hussein has announced that officials at the principal headquarters of the international committee of the red cross in geneva yesterday ( wednesday ) refused to meet with three of its members .
the committee 's spokesman , ziad khasawnah , said to agence france - presse today ( thursday ) " three of the committee 's lawyers were supposed to meet officials at the red cross in geneva yesterday morning , but they excused themselves shortly beforehand " .
he explained that the three french lawyers had headed for the organization 's headquarters in geneva on the basis of an official request from saddam hussein 's defense committee .
he said the aim of the visit had been to get " information on the state of president saddam hussein and the other prisoners and detainees " , indicating that " the reason which the committee put forward for refusing to meet the delegation was that it did not want to interfere in the light of the presence of conflicting statements " about the state of saddam hussein and his imprisoned aides .
the president of the iraqi interim government , ayad allawi , announced in baghdad on tuesday that the trial of " the symbols " of saddam hussein 's former regime would begin in the coming week .
iraqi defense minister hazem shaalan announced on wednesday that ali hassan al-majid , nicknamed " chemical ali " , the nephew of saddam hussein , would be the first of the former regime 's officials to come before the judges .
the committee for the defense of the former iraqi president considered the trial of the symbols of the former regime to be " void " , in view of the fact that the accused 's lawyers had not attended their examinations .
the first anniversary of the arrest of the deposed iraqi president has coincided with conflicting information regarding the hunger strike of leading figures in the former regime inside their secret prison near to baghdad international airport , ranging from the confirmation of the iraqi lawyers to the denial of the american military .
on monday the defense committee had announced the hunger strike of aides to the former iraqi president , laying the blame on pressure exercised on leading figures to compel them to stand witness against him , but were unable to confirm whether saddam himself was participating .
the defense committee for the former iraqi president , which has taken amman for its headquarters , includes 23 permanent members , among them the daughter of the libyan leader , aisha muammar gaddafi , and an american lawyer .

" these terrorist states want to stir up hatred and division to find a way out of the predicament they got themselves and the iraqi people in , which they call the democratic process " , he said .

mahmoud abbas : barrier and settlements will not bring israel security
tulkarm ( west bank ) 12-29 ( afp ) - chairman of the palestine liberation organization mahmoud abbas said today that the separation barrier and the jewish settlements in the west bank would not bring israel security .

abbas , 69 , was given a warm welcome at the camp and was hoisted on shoulders .
abbas is the favorite among the seven candidates to win the january 9th presidential elections to succeed yasser arafat as president of the palestinian authority .

the source , requesting anonymity , said that " ibrahim ahmad abdel majeed al-reemy , a yemeni national , was among the seven militants killed on wednesday evening " .
the source added that al-reemy , who does not figure on the saudi most - wanted list , is an " important person in al-qaeda and is believed to be the intermediary between al-qaeda in saudi arabia and bin laden himself " .
the source went on to say that yesterday 's operation " is a big success for saudi forces " and that " al-reemy is believed to be the current leader of al-qaeda in the saudi kingdom after the killing of khaled ( ali bin ) haj in a shootout in riyadh last march .

the source said although al-qaeda tries to show that its leaders in saudi arabia are saudis , yemenis are actually the ones in charge in saudi " because of the great trust bin laden has in them " .
the source added that saudi authorities had no knowledge of al-reemy 's presence in the kingdom , into which he may have sneaked from a neighboring gulf country .
last night 's shootout , killing seven terrorist militants , occurred shortly after two car bombings against two key security targets in riyadh .

the first protocol concerning a permanent ceasefire was signed by sudan people 's liberation army leader john garang for the southern rebel movement , and general mohamed hassan el-fadow for the sudanese government .
the second protocol on the peace deal implementation methods was signed by the rebel movement spokesman samson kwaje and government spokesman said el - khatib .
sudan people 's liberation army leader john garang and sudanese vice president ali osman taha agreed thursday on the final outstanding points .
the points concerned the last issues that had been impeding peace talks which started in kenya in early 2002 .
the conflict between the arab muslim north and the mainly christian south , who considered themselves marginalized by the khartoum regime , has killed around 1.5 million and displaced four million others .

over 50 thousand protesters in addis ababa against meles zenawi 's peace plan with eritrea
addis ababa 1-2 ( afp ) - more than 50 thousand people demonstrated today in addis ababa protesting at peace plans proposed by ethiopian prime minister meles zenawi to resolve border disputes with eritrea , an agence france - presse correspondent reported .
the demonstration was organized by opposition parties accusing meles zenawi of ceding the country 's territories .
according to the police , between 50 and 60 thousand protesters took part in the demonstration , which comes before key general elections scheduled for may , while organizers put the figure as high as one hundred thousand .
ethiopia and eritrea fought a border war from 1998 to 2000 .
following a peace treaty signed in algiers in 2000 , an independent commission drew the new borders between the two countries , attributing the disputed village of badme to eritrea .
however , ethiopia dismissed the ruling in september 2003 and suspended the demarcation process .
in late november the ethiopian prime minister proposed a peace plan and accepted " in principle " the demarcation put forward by the commission , but with some " modification " .
accordingly , asmara accused addis ababa of buying time and demanded the start of the process of physically marking out the border .
beyenen petros , deputy chairman of the ethiopian united democratic front ( opposition ) , said , " we call on the public to pressure the government into withdrawing its anti - people and anti - national peace initiative . "
he added , " there is no reason to accept the new initiative , which is based on excessive giving
" we have no reason to give an inch of our territory to eritrea . "
" i call upon the ethiopian people to vote against the prime minister and demand a new government that will put forward a new peace initiative , " said gebru asrate , another opposing official .
eritrea had been an ethiopian province until it gained independence in 1993 .
islamist presidential candidate : palestinian leadership failed to defend palestinian issue
ramallah ( west bank ) 1-3 ( afp ) - one of the candidates running for president of the palestinian authority has accused the palestinian leadership of " failing " to defend the " just " palestinian cause over the long past years .
independent islamist candidate sayyed hussein barakah , 48 , told agence france - presse , " there has been a kind of failure in presenting our demands . " he added , " we have been the most unsuccessful lawyer in the most successful case . the lawyer all these years has been the palestinian leadership . "
barakah unveiled details of a meeting he had held with spiritual leader of the hamas movement sheikh ahmed yassin , ten days before his assassination , stressing that sheikh yassin " completely approved of hamas taking part in political life and in the running of palestinian society " .
" honestly and truthfully , sheikh yassin was absolutely convinced of political participation in palestinian society , " he said .
israeli helicopters last march 20 fired three missiles at sheik ahmed yassin as he was leaving a mosque following dawn prayers , instantly killing him and seven others .
barakah who , before announcing his participation in the elections , worked as a general director in the palestinian youth and sport ministry , had also had organizational links with the islamic jihad movement , but has asserted that he cut ties with the movement in mid 1991 .
he said that following the announcement of president yasser arafat 's death , he prepared a memorandum for both the hamas and the islamic jihad movements presenting his idea of the importance of participating in the upcoming presidential elections .
" the response to my memorandum was hamas and islamic jihad 's announcement that they would not take part in the elections , neither by running nor voting , and that they would not support anyone , " he said .
after that , he decided to nominate himself for the presidential elections , pointing out that he had already succeeded in the elections before even running in them , by what he described as " relative support for him among palestinians " .
he expects to play a future role in the islamic movement scope in the palestinian territories , even if he does not win the elections .

european commission launches discussion on european policy for economic migration
strasbourg 1-11 ( afp ) - the european commission today launched a debate on the options for a new policy for economic migration to the european union aimed at covering the expected shortfall in labor as the european population ages .
the debate will take place through a " green paper " which will be distributed to all eu members , the social partners and ngos to issue their proposals and views by april 15 , so as to enable the commission to present a policy plan before the end of the year .
the commission has stated that between " 2010 and 2030 , if present immigration rates continue , the number of working - age people in the 25 eu countries will fall by 20 million " .
it added that " larger immigration flows could become more and more necessary to meet european market needs " .
however , the commission has confirmed that these procedures will not specify the number of workers to be admitted to each country , as it is the responsibility of national administrations , as per the european constitution project .

abdul samei khalil jebara al-ebeidi , the deputy general secretary , said at a press conference , held at the babel hotel in central baghdad , that " the decision to pull out came because of the arrest of the general secretary of the front sheikh hassan zeidan khalaf al-lahibi last december 26 by us troops " .
" the elections do not seem to be a matter of concern to the americans , and there seems to be no immunity for any official of a political body that has an electoral list , which he himself heads , " he added .
al-ebeidi pointed out that " there are also a number of other reasons for our decision to withdraw " , mainly " the deterioration of the security situation throughout the country " .
" we previously requested a six - month postponement of the elections , but our request was not approved , " he said .
al-ebeidi added that his party " presented a copy of the withdrawal decision in a memorandum to the independent electoral commission " .
in response to the question of whether the withdrawal decision had come under the influence of other sunni factions ' decision to boycott the elections , al-ebeidi said , " it was an independent decision unaffected by any other factions . "
general secretary of the national front for the union of iraq hassan zeidan khalaf al-lahibi , 58 , headed the iraqi military academy , which consists of four military colleges , one of which is an engineering college . he also occupied a number of military posts during the former iraqi regime and obtained the rank of lieutenant general in 1996 .

london abandons " for good " splitting sovereignty over gibraltar
madrid 1-12 ( afp ) - gibraltar 's chief minister peter caruana announced today in cadiz that london had abandoned " for good " the principle of splitting sovereignty between spain and britain over the area .
caruana said at a press conference held in cadiz ( andalusia ) that britain had abandoned " for good " the principle of sharing sovereignty with spain because it had been " bad for both gibraltar and spain " .
he stressed that gibraltar , like spain , supports the decolonization of the area .
however , he stated , " we believe the implementation of self - government is necessary , while spain wants to reclaim the area " .
caruana considered that both british and spanish authorities had realized that their attempts to resolve the issue of gibraltar 's sovereignty bilaterally " are doomed to failure because it is a violation of the dignity of gibraltar 's population " .
in november 2002 , 98.97% of gibraltar 's 20 thousand 500 voters said in a referendum that they wanted to remain british .
on december 17 , spain , britain and gibraltar announced the establishment of " a forum of dialogue involving gibraltar " , where spain for the first time agreed that gibraltar 's government should enjoy self - determination , in line with london and madrid .
but spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero declared december 18 that madrid insisted on its demand for sovereignty over gibraltar .
he said that this demand is an " issue that spain will not cede .
it is a basic principle " .
the british colony of gibraltar , with an area of six square kilometers , lies in the south of spain , at the entrance of the strait that connects the atlantic ocean with the mediterranean sea .
spain ceded it to britain in the 1713 treaty of utrecht .

iran denies reports on presence of us commandos in iran
tehran 1-19 ( afp ) - a senior iranian official has dismissed a report that us commandos have infiltrated iran to select nuclear sites for possible air strikes , iranian newspapers reported today .
spokesman for the supreme national security council ali agha mohammadi said , " no commandos are able to enter iran so easily to spy . it would be naive to accept such an idea . "
" we know our borders , " he added .
mohammadi criticized the report by the american " new yorker " magazine , dismissing it as part of a " psychological campaign " against the islamic republic .
the " new yorker " wrote that us commandos had been conducting covert reconnaissance missions inside iran since the summer of 2004 to search out potential nuclear and chemical targets .
although the us defense ministry ( the pentagon ) has rejected the report , speculations regarding a potential us attack to stop iranian nuclear activities have mounted .
speculations mounted even more when us president george bush announced monday in an interview with us television network " nbc " that he could not rule out military action against iran .
bush said , " i hope we can solve it diplomatically , but i wo n't ever take any option off the table . "
mohammadi said the new yorker report " was not even worth thinking about " .
he reiterated that the iranian nuclear program is peaceful and that iran is not working on a nuclear bomb , as the united states alleges .
" we have no nuclear weapons . the international atomic energy agency has searched iranian establishments , " he added .
former iranian president hashemi rafsanjani , still an influential personality in the iranian regime , cautioned the united states on tuesday against thinking of military action against iran .
the iranian news agency quoted rafsanjani as saying , " we are not afraid of foreign enemies ' threats , since they know well that iran , the islamic state with its ancient civilization , is no place for adventurism . "

he added that there had been no clashes between armed forces since the beginning of the ceasefire , pointing out that the lessons derived from this experience would be submitted to the united nations for use in other areas .

prescott made the statement during his meeting with wang ching - min , the deputy mayor of dalian , a city in the province of liaoning famous for its cleanliness and power in the old industrial belt in north - east china .
the north - east region of china , which comprises the provinces of liaoning , jilin and heilongjiang , is said to be the largest and oldest industrial base in china .
the region began to fall behind other regions in the nineties because of the inflated state - owned companies and the scarcity of resources .
in 2003 the central government planned the revival of the industrial base and the investment of more than 60 billion yuans ( 7.2 billion us dollars ) in the region .
prescott said that many cities in the north of britain are the same as those in north - east china in the sense that they are trying to shift from an economy based on coal and iron to become modern industrial cities .
dalian sets a good example of this transition and will direct the whole region towards new industries .
wang said that dalian hopes to boost cooperation with britain particularly in the sea shipping business .
dalian has 71 british investment projects most of which are in the fields of transformational industry , trade and the service industry .
contractual investments are estimated at 430 million us dollars and actual investments at about 158 million us dollars .

moscow december 5th / xinhua / a source close to abkhazia 's prime minister khazhba said today that the former presidential candidates of georgia 's breakaway republic of abkhazia , sergei bagapsh and raul khajimba , have agreed to hold the second round of presidential elections , itar - tass news agency reported .
the two sides , through the mediation of prime minister nodar khazhba and russian deputy prosecutor - general vladimir kolesnikov , also agreed to immediately lift the siege of all the state buildings captured by supporters of the two candidates , including the complex of government buildings , the president 's office and the abkhazian television and radio company in the cities of pitsunda , tkvarcheli and gudauta .
abkhazia held a presidential vote on october 3 , when bagapsh collected 43,336 votes and khajimba 30,815 votes .

iraqi foreign minister fears civil war in iraq
baghdad december 5th / xinhua / iraqi justice minister malik dohan al-hassan has expressed fear that civil war may break out if the interim government insists on holding the iraqi elections on schedule in late january .
malik al-hassan , in a release to american ( sua ) radio on sunday , voiced his support for some iraqi parties ' call for the postponement of the elections until the security situation improved , considering that the time was not appropriate to hold elections .
al-hassan added that leaders and chiefs of tribes in mosul , tikrit , baqouba and ramadi declined to take part in the elections and called for a boycott if the interim government rejects the demands of the provinces ' residents , calling for the division of iraq into electoral districts and the representation of provinces in the national assembly on the basis of population ratio .
he said despite the iraqi people 's aspiration for an elected government , so that foreign forces vacate iraq , it would not be possible to hold the elections amid the current security situation .
the justice minister stated that it would be impossible to guarantee the security of voters on their way to cast ballots , just as it would be impossible to guarantee the security of candidates during election campaign rallies .
a number of leading sunni muslim politicians have previously urged the government to postpone the elections for six months in order to give authorities enough time to secure polling stations and to convince sunni clerics to abandon their call for an election boycott .
a spokesman for the interim prime minister iyad allawi has said that the government insists on january 30th , after receiving confirmation from the iraqi elections committee that the elections can be held even in sunni areas wrecked by insurgents .
meanwhile , us president george w. bush stressed on december 2nd that the iraqi elections must be held on january 30th as scheduled , saying , " the time has come for iraqis to head for the polls . "
african union expresses its confidence in annan
addis ababa december 6th / xinhua / the african union executive council today expressed its unshaken confidence in united nations secretary general kofi annan , who is currently under fire because of accusations that his son received payments for seven years from a company participating in the oil - for - food program between the united nations and iraq .
in an emergency session , the council said the un secretary general had constantly demonstrated great commitment to the ideals of the united nations and a determination to reposition it in the globalizing world .

the council is expected to discuss in its session today issues related to the union 's budget .
the secretary general 's son kojo annan was investigated for alleged corruption .
the corruption rumors surfaced in january when an iraqi newspaper published a list of around 270 prominent figures from at least 46 countries , saying they received oil money from saddam hussein 's regime
the list was said to include benon sevan , a united nations official who had been in charge of the program , but he vigorously denied the charge .
a us congress committee later accused the international organization of poor management of the program , which it said allowed saddam hussein to acquire more than 10 billion dollars in oil revenues .
annan launched an internal investigation in february , but cancelled it in march to allow for a broader , independent investigation .
the oil - for - food program began in december 1996 to allow iraq to export 69.5 billion us dollars worth of oil .
the united nations supervised iraq 's oil sales and its purchase of humanitarian supplies . the program was shut down in november last year .

sources : candidacy of marwan barghouti for presidential elections illegal
gaza december 11th / xinhua / palestinian sources close to the fatah movement today ( saturday ) said that the candidacy of marwan barghouti , the secretary general of the movement in the west bank who is jailed in israel , was illegal .
the sources , who asked to remain unnamed , explained that the candidacy of barghouti who is held in israel on five life terms " breaks one of the stipulations of the presidential electoral law of the palestinian national authority " .
they added : " the law requires anyone wishing to present himself as a candidate to the palestinian presidential elections to resign from any position he might hold and to submit this written resignation to the general electoral committee , particularly members of public organizations , judges , and security officials , and this applies to members of the palestinian legislative council . "
the sources explained that " hassan kharisha , the acting chief of the legislative council , was forced to withdraw his decision to contest the presidential elections after stating through members of the council that he had to choose between continuing in his membership of the legislative council or submitting his resignation in order to contest the elections , as palestinian law states . "
the sources confirmed that " the same issue applies to barghouti , who announced his own candidacy without presenting his resignation from the legislative council , an action counting as a legal infringement , which discontinues his candidacy for these elections . "
sources said that the 10th article relating to candidacy for the post of president states that " the rulings of article / 14 / of this law apply to candidates for the post of president , excepting the president of the palestinian national authority . "
article / 14 / , under the title candidacy and the holding of public offices , states that " taking into account the rulings of this law , candidacy may not be accepted from palestinian national authority ministers , employees of government or public administration , heads and members of municipal councils , or employees of state institutions active in the area , who do not resign ten days prior to the deadline for the announcement of the final candidates lists , with their resignation being considered acceptable .

comment : bizarre reference to " chinese threat " in japanese defense program
tokyo december 11th / xinhua / on friday the japanese government revealed a ten - year defense program , which describes china as a probable threat alongside the democratic people 's republic of korea , without offering any justification .
whilst democratic korea does not have diplomatic relations with tokyo , china is a state with which japan has signed a peace agreement and with which it has highly solid economic relations .
in spite of the diplomacy of the wording , the summary of the japanese defense program states that china and democratic korea are the only neighboring countries to pose a threat .
the document issued by the japanese government on friday states that " it is necessary to keep watch over china 's nuclear and ballistic missile program , its modernization of air and sea forces , and attempts to expand naval activity . "
china and japan normalized their relations 32 years ago .
in addition to the treaty of peace and friendship which was signed six years after that , the two states agreed to renew their relationship to become one of partnership in 1998 .
on the strength of the three previous treaties , trade between them has increased 130 - fold , and is expected to reach 150 million us dollars this year .
china may become japan 's largest trade partner in the very near future .
total japanese investment in china stands at 46 million dollars .
the large integration of the two countries ' economies has spilled over into long - term friendship and peace between china and japan which is of great importance , not only to these two countries , but also with regard to peace and prosperity in east asia and the world as a whole .
in this context , it is difficult to see why japan believes that china is a source of threat .
the japanese chief cabinet secretary , hiroyuki hosoda , has tried to play down the issue of " the chinese threat . "
he said to journalists on friday that the new defense program did not indicate that china was a threat , but that as a state it merited japan 's attention in the security arena .
comment : bizarre reference to " chinese threat " in japanese defense program / first and last addition /
not even the japanese media is convinced by his explanation , stating that it was the first time the japanese defense program had referred to the " chinese threat " , albeit indirectly .
the japanese government move in bringing out the " chinese threat " contradicts the two peoples ' ambitions for permanent peace and friendship .
chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman zhang qi yue said china expressed " its extreme dissatisfaction " with the japanese step , saying it was " completely irresponsible and unjustified " .
it is well - known that the chinese people are peace - loving .
wherever china is strongest , it does not constitute a threat to any other state , but on the contrary contributes constructively to the development of its neighbors and to regional and international stability and prosperity .
china hopes that japan will reconsider its fears of its asian neighbors and aspire to caution in security and military policies .
japan must keep to the path of peace and contribute to regional peace and development .
it should be noted that japan seems to follow the united states in security policy .
it is possible that japan may change its defense priorities to countering terrorism following the september 11th attacks , and strengthen its defense capacities against what it calls " the danger of democratic korea " .
through its unbelievably enthusiastic attitude towards the missile defense system in cooperation with the united states , its real aims are revealed .
it is not at all satisfactory that this missile system is designed only for the aforementioned targets .

the 15th session of the saudi yemeni joint coordination council , which was held in sanaa in july 2003 , resulted in the signing of seven treaties for bilateral cooperation .
it should be noted that the saudi yemeni joint coordination council was founded in 1975 , and that its meetings were interrupted for a period of 10 years , then resumed afresh in december 2000 after the signing of an international border treaty between the two countries . its sessional meetings are held once a year , alternating between the two countries ' capitals , riyadh and sanaa .

the coalition forces , controlled by the united states , have been continually increasing since their deployment in afghanistan three years ago , following the fall of the taliban in 2001 .

turkish prime minister calls for settlement of cyprus question
ankara december 28th / xinhua / the turkish prime minister , recep tayyip erdogan , called on tuesday for active measures to be taken to solve the cyprus question .
erdogan stated before the general parliament 's collective vote on the 2005 budgetary program that " turkey cannot protect its interests in cyprus if it insists on policies of insolvability , and continues to be negative , acting with a strategy of self - defense " .

chinese scientists discover dinosaur - eating mammal
beijing january 13th / xinhua / a report published today ( thursday ) stated chinese scientists have discovered a fossilized dinosaur - eating mammal in liaoning province , northeast china .
the discovery , by hu yaoming , wang yuanqing and li chuankui , all from the chinese academy of sciences institute of paleontology and paleoanthropology , and meng jin from the museum of nature in new york , was published in a paper in the british journal nature .
the fossilized mammal lived during the mesozoic era .
the discovery revealed that some large - size mammals that lived in that era may have been carnivorous , and brave enough to compete with dinosaurs for food and living space .
li said that the undigested bones , including teeth and limbs , of a small dinosaur had been discovered in its stomach .
li added that the unbroken joints meant that the mammal tore up and swallowed the prey , without biting or chewing .
he stated that prior to the latest discovery , most scientists had assumed that mammals in the mesozoic era were fairly small and nocturnal .
they were supposed to have eaten insects and not dared to come near dinosaurs .
li said that the new discoveries challenge the long - held view , and proved that some primitive mammals were larger than middle - sized dinosaurs .
scientists had previously believed that they ate small animals and walked around in daylight .
based on this analysis , the dinosaur which had been eaten was a third of the size of the mammal .
