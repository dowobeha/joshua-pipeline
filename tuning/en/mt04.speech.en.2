human rights are basic principles and great ideals which we took care to include in the constitutional reforms put forward before our people so that the countrys constitution will mirror the goodness of our political systems checks , reflecting our civilized plan , our societys advancement and its conscious involvement in the most supreme of values produced by humanity .
such values which we included and affirmed in the constitution because there is no turning point from them , asserting by that our view that is based on the close relation between civil and political rights and economic , social cultural rights , and on the integration between them and not favoring one over the other .
we reject all forms of discrimination and machiavellian policies with all their ills , and as much as we reject individualism as a cover for averting such universal values and principles , we refuse that the same values and principles be a prelude to revoking the cultural and civilized individualisms of peoples .
the creation of the consultative council is an extension of forms of people 's representation in the legislative branch , and an affirmation of the principle of participation as a basis for democratic practice , and at the same time , is keeping up with the advances witnessed by parties in all fields and an interaction with the vitality of the civilized society throughout the years of change .
it is an evolution of the legislative branch in structure and representation forms that supports the values of the republic , consolidates its institutions , and offers by it a higher standing for active powers and national resources .
this council , through its members of practitioners , lawyers , and peasants , will empower professional organizations , such organizations which are full of energies and have a deep - rooted history of struggle .
the building of the information and communications society constitutes to tunisia a fundamental national option that we have worked to affirm within the framework of a comprehensive consolidation via continuous structural reforms and supporting the basic entity for communications and information technologies in our country as some of the most important pillars for the knowledge economy and a basic element of advancing the course of growth .
basically , we strived to cultivate human resources through designing an integrated plan to standardize information science education at various educational levels and creating higher institutes for technological studies .
this is in addition to intensifying the creation of specialists in communications and information science and developing their capacities for understanding modern technology and perfecting its utility for serving development , besides establishing technological centers and venues for reactivated projects throughout the country .
we have also focused our efforts on spreading the digital culture on the widest scale thanks to regular programs in various media outlets , creating information centers devoted to children throughout the republic , and linking educational institutions in all stages of elementary , secondary and academic education with the internet network , in addition to standardizing the information and internet clubs in cultural venues and creating a network of internet centers that are accessible to the public .
also , enabling median - income families with aid and incentives to own family computers on a wide scale .
tunisias relations with the united states are distinguished , traditional and are based on mutual trust and respect . they are relations that go back to the eighteenth century and specifically to the year 1797 , the date of the first trade agreement between tunisia and the united states .
there is no doubt that my visit to this friendly country , for which we hold all respect and admiration , is part of the regular and intensive discussions and communications between the two countries officials at the highest levels and falls within the context of the solid relations between the two sides .
we believe that tunisia , through her distinct geographical location as a bridge that links the two banks of the mediterranean and through enacting legislation and offering incentives to investors , provides the ideal ground for additional investment and the revitalization of joint projects .
the message we carry with us emanates from tunisias history and her present as we affirm our countrys solid belief in the values of justice , liberty and democracy , and from her relentless quest for spreading peace and stability in the world on the basis of solidarity and tolerance between nations and peoples , values with which we share with the friendly american people .
i note at the outset that there is no room for a delay in the arenas of democracy and freedom of expression in tunisia from the viewpoint that building every democratic society augments comprehensive developmental work .
these are two paths that we strived to advance with all determination and steadiness without favoring one over the other . that is why we have established our approach on a compromise where civil and political rights are interlinked with social , economic and cultural rights due to our awareness that the dignity of men is only realized through the availability of means of honorable living , such as affirming the right to healthcare , education , work , protection of family , children and women , and supporting the needy social classes who have no supporter by guaranteeing the freedom of expression , political and mass assembly , and securing democracy and plurality .
economic and social development could not have been realized if ones opinion in our country had no weight , his rights had no sanctity or his dignity had no consideration .
we have adopted gradualism as a way to foster the democratic and plural structure in order to guard it against any defection or relapse , and we have taken into consideration the failure of others and the risks of the trend of those who hide behind religion threatening our country and our societys stability and development .
in the area of human rights , we have made big strides , which we are unable to detail here , and have laid the foundation for institutions and mechanisms that protect them in accordance with a comprehensive and integrated outlook for such rights .
the countdown toward war , apparently and seemingly , has started . our efforts , which have so far focused in one direction which is preventing the war , must now move in a new direction which is shielding our precious homeland and dear citizens from its consequences and implications .
as a protection for this homeland , its holy sites , security and safety , your state has made the following decisions , decisions which i have no doubt - god willing - that they do express your principal positions , are compatible with your commitment to arab and islamic values , and enjoy your unanimous approval .
first : the kingdom will not in any case participate in the war against brotherly iraq , and its armed forces will not , under any circumstance , enter one inch of the iraqi territories .
second : we expect that the war will end by merely implementing security council resolution ( 1441 ) for removing weapons of mass destruction , and we utterly reject violating iraq 's unity , independence , resources or internal security , or subjecting her to a military occupation . we have informed the government of the united states of our unambiguous saudi position .
third : the exceptional circumstances that surrounded this crisis for the past twelve years compel us not to enter into a miscalculated military adventure that exposes the safety of our homeland and our people to dangers .
nevertheless , we must say that if events take a different direction from the one we have elaborated on or if war exceeds its declared objectives , then we will have a different position , and we will cross that bridge when we come to it .
my country has had the honor of chairing the general assembly of the arab satellite communications organization ( arabsat ) for the period of last year .
during this period , thanks to your enlightened directives and the collaboration of all efforts at the organization at various levels , the organization has achieved remarkable profits that exceeded all expectations , reaching more than 74 million dollars , an a rate increase of 56% in comparison with the results of the year 2000 , which affirms the confidence of those who deal with this organization and the validity of its approach .
your presence here , despite your numerous engagements , clearly represents the special attention your government pays to the growth of the communications sector and its deep understanding of the strategic role this sector plays in the economic and social growth in our countries .
the growth and development of the communications sector is today at the core of the interests of our states and countries because of its importance in lessening distances , strengthening ties between peoples and nations , and facilitating the exchange of information and services in all vital fields , which returns a great benefit for all cultural , economic and social activities in order to take advantage of the latest technological developments .
there is no doubt that arabsat , the pioneering arab organization , has played a vital role in bringing the peoples of the arab countries together and bringing these peoples together with the peoples of other countries of the world by the various and advanced services it offers at all levels via its satellite system .
the organization has taken several steps in the right direction .
allow me , ladies and gentlemen , to offer congratulations in the name of my country to the african commission on human and peoples rights for the perfect work it has done in the interest of advancing and protecting human rights in our african continent .
the convening of the twenty - first session gives me a good opportunity to affirm the mauritanian islamic republic 's adherence to islam and to democratic principles that were outlined by the international declaration of human rights and the african charter for human and peoples ' rights , the two documents that are considered a reference for our country 's constitution which was ratified by a popular referendum in july of the year 1991 .
this constitution , which the state of law emanated from and which protected and consolidated basic liberties , established plural democracy and guaranteed independence of the judiciary , thus giving human rights a constitutional character and stated that : ( man 's freedom , dignity and his right to equality cannot be guaranteed except in a society which believes in the precedence of fairness .
it pleases at this juncture to mention that since the publication of the constitution , public authorities are working and are intensifying their efforts for consolidating the framework of human rights implementation through adapting and reviewing various laws which explicitly and unambiguously express the directives and personal commitment of the president of the republic , mr. maaouiya ould sid ahmad al-taya , for the purpose of enhancing the working and performance of our democracy , integrating all marginalized sectors , promoting women , protecting children and involving the civil society in the effort to growing the country .
we must point here to the reforms dealing with administration , the judiciary , the educational system , election law , funding of political parties , the civil state , and the recent ratification of the law that includes the personal records registry due to the positive impact of such reforms on improving human rights .
at the outset , i would like to thank you for this warm welcome and the joy with which you have received us , which is what you have accustomed us to whenever we visit this dear historical city .
the purpose of this visit , as was stated in mr. mayor 's speech , is to lay the cornerstone for the reconstruction and expansion of the al-nimaa airport to become an international airport capable of receiving large aircraft , and also to inaugurate the launching of the mobile telephone network in the city and the opening of a tourist complex there .
the inauguration of the water project will take place in days . we know that the water network has reached the city in large quantities that exceed the drinking needs and allow its utilization in agriculture and to create factories and economic projects .
without electricity , water and means of communications , it is not possible to institute a comprehensive economic development of real value . such means have become available today , thank god .
we wanted through this visit to draw the attention of businessmen in al-nimaa , the productive cooperatives and various active national economists to that it is time to embark on investing inside the country , and especially in the city of al-nimaa .
at the outset , i thank you for the warm welcome and the joy with which you have received us .
the reception was magnificent and the joy great , which is what you have accustomed us to whenever we visit your beautiful province .
the purpose of this visit is to get in touch with you and to talk with you about national and local issues of interest to you and provide you with information on the steps that our developmental course has taken .
as you know , the general situation is relatively good .
on the economic front , the economic performance is continually improving and the annual growth rate continues to rise , while the rate of inflation is declining and the markets are booming .
overall , the state has become stronger economically and there is nothing to worry about . on the contrary , all indicators are favorable and our debt reduction will allow saving large sums that will be spent to raise the standard of living for citizens and to provide basic social services .
it is my pleasure at the beginning of this speech to convey to you the greetings of the president of the mauritanian islamic republic , mr. / maaouiya ould sid ahmad al-taya , and his wishes for good luck and success for the proceedings of this summit .
on this occasion , i offer , in the name of the president of the republic , warm congratulations to his excellency sheikh hamad bin khalifa al thani on his valuable initiative and the good conditions that have been made available to assure the success of our summit .
i would like at this time to offer my sincere thanks to the authorities in the sister state of qatar for the fine welcome , generous hospitality , and great attention that we have received .
also , from this venue , i cannot but value the expeditious efforts exerted by the secretary - general of the islamic conference organization , mr. / abdel wahid belqaziz , in the interests of our organization .
this emergency summit is meeting under a circumstance that is marked by the gravity of the challenges that face our nation and the big dangers that impend upon it requiring more cooperation and solidarity from all of us .
regarding the iraqi crisis which we are debating today in the framework of this summit , we must exert all possible efforts to avoid war , add to the suffering of the brotherly iraqi people and expose the region to immense dangers , and to work for finding a peaceful solution out of the commitment to international legitimacy and the implementation of the security council resolutions .
we have seen , during the course of less than one generation , the fastest progress of freedom in the story of democracy that extends over two thousand five hundred years .
historians will offer their explanations in the future for the reasons that led this to happen , but we do know now some of the reasons that they will cite .
it is not a coincidence that this large number of democracies has surfaced at the same time that the most influential countries are themselves democratic .
the united states has made military and moral pledges in europe and asia that protected free nations from aggression and created the conditions that new democracies may flourish under .
alongside providing security to entire countries , we have also offered inspiration to persecuted peoples , in prison camps , in banned associations meetings and in secret churches .
men and women have known that the entire world does not share the same nightmare with them .
i came to you today to present you with four simple facts , by which i point out two rights :
the first fact that i shall start with is that iraq 's long night is over .
the excruciating experience that the iraqis have endured throughout three decades of suppression , persecution , tyranny and humiliation has ended with the fleeing of the head of the regime and his followers and with the collapse of the icons that he had erected throughout baghdad and the rest of iraq .
the second fact is that the liberation of iraq , and what happened was definitely a liberation , would not have happened if it were n't for the determination exhibited by president bush and committed to by the coalition countries with the united states and the united kingdom in the forefront .
as we hear today the voices of those who are skeptical of the intentions of the american and british governments from carrying out the liberation , we invite them just to visit the mass graves , the drained marshes and halbaja , and to review the lists of those who were deprived by the regime from their right to life .
the third fact is that the liberation came as an embodiment for a comprehensive iraqi national will , and came as a result of the relentless work carried out by the iraqi opposition groups against the deposed regime in the span of long years , during which they offered hundreds of thousands of martyrs , not the last of whom was martyr ayatollah mohammad baqer al-hakim and his companions , may god have mercy on all of them , as they wrote another page in the iraqi heroic records last august on iraqi martyr 's day , nor was it martyr aqila al-hashemi , who was reached struck by the hand of betrayal .
we have set our resolve for change and development and for taking the initiative without hesitation no matter what the difficulties are so that jordan 's roots may remain solid and steady within its domain and in the world . jordan , in its hashemite mission , is jordan the leader , jordan the model and the example .
the convening of your esteemed council today is consummation of the institutional buildup , in harmony with the constitution , which affirms your legislative and vital role , exemplifies through you the hopes of jordan 's sons and daughters and embodies their aspirations and the horizons of a prosperous future .
along the steps of our promise and our faith in the principle of " jordan first " , your esteemed council represents the future of our sons and daughters , and our children in the desert and the countryside , and in the village , the camp and the city . that 's why we want it to be a legislative council distinguished in its performance and an authority to help our government when it puts together its comprehensive plans and its national programs in order to effect positive change and respond to the aspirations and hopes of our youths from " jordan first " to jordan at the present and in the future .
our vision for jordan of the future is based on a solid basis , the crux of which is that jordan is a democratic , modern country and a genuine part of her arab and islamic nation to which she is proud of belonging and of her noble hashemism .
she is committed out of a total conviction to projecting this bright and real image of islam , as a belief and a practice , in order to promote " jordan " as a civilized model for tolerance , freedom of speech , creativity and distinction .
here you are , as evident by your speeches that were filled with the scent of jordan , her north and her south , her middle and her east , her lowland , her highland and her desert , about to clear your national conscience and cast your votes in such publicity with little precedence that encompasses options for consolidating diversity and freedom under the watchful eyes of our people and the blessing of our cherished leader , the essence of expectation and hope .
yes , you are about to fold one page to start pages of cooperation , integration , monitoring , accountability and consultation .
no one is ignorant of the fact that we are in the same boat ; we get along , disagree , agree and part . it is our sole , final and eternal homeland , it is our sole , final and eternal throne , and it is jordan until god inherits earth and what 's on it .
i tell you truthfully that reality is difficult , the load is heavy and the territory is vibrant and gyrating .
but all of this will not make our knees tremble and will not make our resolve wane since with the leadership of abi al-hussein , the carrier of al-hussein 's
you have tested over the past four years the leader 's determination and his will that is made of steel , cut from the rocks of petra , the spearhead of muta and the epic of al-yarmouk , and you have found that what has been accomplished in this short period was stunning and magnificent .
thanks be to god , prayers and peace be upon our master the messenger of god , his family and his companions . esteemed ladies and gentlemen of parliamentarians , we , with the opening of this parliamentary session consummate the renewal of the constitutional institutions , embodying our solid royal will for giving the democratic path its straight direction , as an option with no return , despite the seriousness of the national and international challenges .
given that we are proud of this quality transformation , does this mean that we have achieved the perfection we seek ?
we have stressed repeatedly that there is no democracy without democrats and that democracy is a long , hard road and not a fictitious arena for war on positions . it is a committed citizenry and a practice from which there is no deviation , for the sound management of public affairs , especially the local ones .
it can only be fortified by consolidating the culture of citizenry that is entrusted with political parties and civil society authorities , and by improving the living conditions of citizens so that they feel it in their daily routine .
regardless of the composition of elected councils , we will not cease to pose the fundamental question : is election in itself considered an objective and the end of the road ?
no , since respecting the popular will requires discarding the democracy of seats mentality and adhering to the virtue of the growth democracy .
it pleases me to speak to you after the conclusion of the second national meeting for intellectual dialogue , which was held recently in the vicinity of the sacred house of god in honored mecca , the theme of which was " extremism and moderation : a comprehensive and systematic view . " this meeting has embodied the spirit of islamic and patriotic brotherhood . the dialogue was taking place in an atmosphere of mutual courtesy and respect .
the meeting discussed important studies prepared by experienced specialists and addressed extremism in all of its aspects . the meeting ended with constructive recommendations which support national unity and foster the virtues of dialogue , moderation and tolerance .
these recommendations will be treated by the state with the attention they deserve .
i am looking forward to the convening of the next meeting in the expanse of enlightened medina , the city of our prophet and master , mohammad , may god 's blessings and peace be upon him , to discuss two important subjects which are " education and women . "
besides the organized dialogue that is taking place at the king abdul aziz center for national dialogue , the saudi society is witnessing these days a wide dialogue that includes sectors of the community and is taking place via different media outlets .
dialogue in principle is a positive and healthy phenomenon , but we must take the utmost care so that a blessing does not turn into a curse . any dialogue that does not adhere to the methodology , rules and manners of dialogue will turn into chaos that does not fill a void and hurts , not helps .
under the framework of deliberations that are taking place at the international court of justice regarding the legal status of the dividing wall that israel has constructed in the occupied west bank , the kingdom delivered its legal statement before the court at the beginning of the deliberations and in which it affirmed the illegality of the wall as constituting a flagrant violation of the fourth geneva convention and all relevant international resolutions and treaties .
this wall not only constitutes isolation for the palestinians , but it stands as an obstacle to all initiatives and peaceful solutions put forward to find a just resolution for the conflict by a unilateral step that makes it very hard to reach any future settlement , in addition to imposing a new reality on the ground that is certain to raise the complexity of the situation and add new burdens to the existing fundamental issues in the palestinian - israeli conflict .
with regards to iraq , the kingdom welcomes the results that came out of the fifth conference of neighboring countries , which was held in kuwait recently , where iraq 's participation for the first time in the meeting added much significance and optimism and allowed the opportunity to identify what iraq needs from her neighbors and what iraq 's neighbors need from her .
whereas the iraqi territorial integrity , respecting its sovereignty and independence , and the right of the iraqi people in determining their destiny and political future were thus affirmed .
the neighboring countries affirmed their readiness to support and backup all diplomatic and political efforts that aim at achieving the desired objectives to enable iraq to fulfill her positive role as an active member of the international community and to build positive relations with her neighbors governed by courtesy , respect and peace in accordance with the rules of international law and commitment to international treaties .
the development of a strong and pragmatic partnership between us is justified by the realities of history and geography , as well as requisites of logic .
in addition to the benefits resulting from freedom of commerce , economic globalization and technological advances , we are also compelled by them to increase communication and open dialogue to be able to understand each other better .
especially in view of the challenges that the serious events our region is experiencing have imposed upon us and which have produced many wrong notions , assumptions and pre - disposed positions in political , cultural or religious aspects and must be addressed to avoid their negative impact on our future .
it pleases me today to review with you some suggestions and visions in the quest to achieve this objective .
at the outset , i would like to affirm our solid conviction that change and reform are regarded as a critical necessity in the arab world if we want our sincere ambitions for progress and development to come true .
reform must come from the inside to guarantee the welfare of citizens and to respond to their aspirations toward a prosperous society governed by the principles of justice and equal rights and obligations .
human development and economic prosperity are key to a better future for the middle east .
the european community and the arab world can achieve great gains by reaching this objective .
any effort in this quest is certain to reinforce our cooperation toward achieving peace and stability in this troubled part of the world .
it is very important to work to put an end to the occupation and the cycle of violence , extremism and terrorism .
this objective cannot be achieved without a deeper understanding , good faith and adopting fair policies and the commitment to implementing them .
we must avoid giving the opportunity to this minority of terrorists and extremists to fill the minds of our youths with hate , resentment and role models .
naturally , a group of countries are arguing that the court should not give any consulting opinion on this issue as the united nations general assembly requested .
the argument they present is simply the argument that was presented on other issues asking for a consulting opinion to imply that the issue is ambiguous or the court will be in danger of pre - judging the negotiations or deviating from its judicial function .
such arguments before this court have failed in the past .
at the same time , it is noted that one finds these same countries advocating the alternative opinion and think that the court should not give an opinion , but they continue to assert their position on the crux of the matter at a time when the court is beginning to voice an opinion .
this is not the issue here .
for example , on the issue of weapons of mass destruction , seven countries argued in written statements that the court should not give an opinion .
i am also pleased to point to the distinguished presence by top officials at the european union , which is contributing to launching the first serious and practical step in the area of treating solid waste that includes all of the lebanese regions ( municipalities and villages ) , in order to stimulate balanced and fair development under the framework of the arla program .
the practice of municipal work in lebanon is not recent . the domestic community has been familiar with it , identified its problems , and is seeking to develop it and to expand the range of its services in cooperation with concerned administrations and supporting authorities , whether local or international .
the lebanese government , especially the ministry of interior and municipalities , realized the importance of municipalities working as local authorities managing a public affair distinguishing the civil society , meeting the needs of this society , facilitating citizens affairs and maintaining public health , which is considered a vital need due to the ecological imbalance resulting from industrial development . if we do not accelerate addressing the waste problem , we will face an ecological disaster .
from here comes the importance of cooperation between local administrations across the borders since science , knowledge and development do not recognize geographical borders . they belong to the whole of humanity .
thanks to the existing great cooperation between officials at the european union and the lebanese government , we are truly at the stage of finding solutions following the availability of financial support . we went from debating the problems and their impact to a stage of study and implementation , which is considered a national responsibility that falls on the shoulders of everyone without exception and entrusted to elected authorities from the people carrying their full responsibilities after the law has granted them the authorities that enable them to achieve developmental objectives contributing to removing the danger of pollution , which does not spare anyone .
it pleases me to meet with the head of the european union commission in lebanon , ambassador and friend patrick renauld , to sign an agreement protocol for funding solid waste treatment projects at the municipalities , which is being funded by the " arla " program with a grant from the european union .
the agreement protocol includes the opening of an independent account in the amount of 10.2 million euros allocated for funding projects proposed by the municipalities for the treatment of solid waste under the management of the minister of administrative development and the supervision of the european union commission .
the signing of this protocol will allow securing actual support for the municipalities by locating funding for one of the most important dilemmas they face , the treatment of solid waste , which officials at the municipal councils often declare their desire to address as a top priority .
this support is available to all of lebanon 's municipalities without exception , whether they are municipal unions or a group of municipalities or villages without municipalities . they all can benefit from this project by merely presenting the proper documentation .
this documentation is subjected to study and selection with the participation of a committee in which the ministry of interior and municipalities , the ministry of the environment and the development and construction council are represented .
the agreement protocol notes the establishment of a specialized unit at the ministry of administrative development equipped with qualified technical and administrative personnel to manage this project .
it has been known that modern development has three pillars : the state , the private sector and the civil society .
as great as the capabilities of the state and the private sectors are , the capabilities of the civil society are just as weak .
however , there is no balanced , fair and permanent development without developing the civil society .
based on this view , the european union has decided by an initiative from its ambassador in lebanon , friend patrick renault , to support the lebanese civil society by presenting a grant in the amount of one million euros allocated for projects proposed by various lebanese non - governmental organizations , different unions and all non - profit cooperatives .
the amount of funding for each project ranges between 25 thousand to 50 thousand euros .
the material value of this support is not the most important .
i say that because as part of our keeping up with the archeological sites , archeological discoveries and buildings , we face a problem of attacks , a problem of protecting offenders in a number of areas under different headings , and consequently , there is some vandalism in archeological buildings and areas , and offenses at archeological sites classified by unesco . this classification is at risk because of such attacks .
naturally , we are in lebanon where no one dares to commit any act unless he is afforded protection , and if he did , by coincidence or out of greed , without prior protection , subsequent protection is made available because we are unable to hold anyone accountable or take action against anyone .
we at the ministry of culture , with or without this legislation , send more than one letter over consecutive weeks about violations in certain areas . nothing is implemented out of such comments , letters and correspondence , and the reasons are always political interventions in the areas , ministers , celebrities , activists and a social situation .
it is only an attempt for benefiting this person or that person . if the situation remains as such , we will be wasting time trying to enact a citizen legislation or a heritage legislation in the full meaning of the word .
fair rule is an ancient dream that greece had with plato 's " republic " , fascinated the arabs with al-farabi in " the virtuous city " , and occupied the western thinking through the writings of hobbes , montesquieu , hegel and marx .
islam has known , before fair rule , the experience of " the fair predecessor . "
the term rule came in the arabic language to mean not only managing the public affair , as is the case in other languages , but to include the meanings of justice , knowledge and wisdom which prevailed under " the fair predecessor . "
the arab dream of fair rule collides with numerous challenges , external and internal .
leading the external challenges , we mention israel 's occupation of arab territories and her continuous aggression on arabs militarily , media - wise , economically and culturally , which hinders the progress of security , peace and development in the middle east , in addition to the absence of arab solidarity in the face of occupation , aggression , globalization and intense economic competition .
leading the internal challenges , we point to the arab failure in the areas of liberties , democracy , human rights and equality between men and women , in addition to the spread of the curse of poverty , disease , unemployment , pollution and informational illiteracy .
the men and women trainees , to whom we are giving certificates today , embody two closely - related principles which are on the priority list of any public administration and they are : developing human resources and citizen service .
the ministry of administrative development has been working since its inception on two directions that are tied to those two principles : the direction of training in human resources development in the administrative and technological fields , in addition to training components in special projects including plans to improve performance , and a direction for providing quality service for citizens coupled with savings in cost and time via promoting a new administrative culture and through procedure simplification mechanisms .
it pleases me today to have the ministry of finance , and specifically the real estate tax administration , participate in giving out the certificates to 68 observers from all governances who have trained over ten weeks at a cost of 30 thousand euros funded by a grant from the european union as part of the arla project .
first , i thank the european union represented in the person of ambassador and friend , patrick renauld .
i also thank the finance institute for hosting us and the master plan company for its fine implementation of the training .
i especially thank the joint working team of the ministries of finance and administrative development for the effort it made to make the training process a success .
at the outset , i would like to thank his excellency the minister and friend , mr. fouad al-saad , for launching the " citizen legislation " project and his excellency the minister , mr. kareem baqradoni , for following up on this initiative , as well as the rest of the working team who came out with a preliminary draft for the citizen legislation dealing with public funds .
the legislation in its conventional meaning is a text that sets a certain vision and outlines responsibilities which those concerned must observe in order to achieve that vision , and consequently , the legislation becomes the moral basis for such a vision and a tool for achieving it .
on the financial issue , i hasten here to remind that since the conception of the nucleus of what we now refer to as a foundation under the state 's name , money was its essence , and therefore , taxes and levies were the primary source for the funds that the state needed to run its own affairs and to achieve and carry out the services expected and demanded by citizens of the state .
consequently , taxes and levies were inherent in the tactics of all countries .
based on that , what is referred to as public funds emerged , which is the subject of the draft legislation we are currently discussing .
taxes and levies , which constitute the biggest part of public funds , are collected in the name of citizens , and they are supposed to go in tandem with the interests of citizens as well .
we have grown accustomed to brotherly lebanon being a permanent and renewed venue for intellect , education , culture and science , and here we are today witnessing the opening of one of the important international meetings to review and discuss the innovations and modern technology tools available to the education industry after we witnessed , only a week ago and in this place too , an arab intellectual meeting on education .
there is no doubt that the issues of education and development of human resources are considered , more than at any time before , the most important elements in the development of countries , boosting their scientific presence and affirming their real independence under the sharp competitive environments our world is experiencing today .
i will review in my presentation some of the futuristic and compelling issues that emerged as challenges facing the higher education systems in the arab world , taking into consideration the effective forces that exist in the world arena and which contributed in the first place to shaping these futuristic issues and challenges which i shall talk about .
the first of these forces is the increase in demand for higher education :
as you all know , the acceleration in the economic , scientific and technological variables , and the know - how explosion necessitated an increased demand for higher education and an unprecedented great interest because the world has gone through an era of major transformations that have led to the emergence of a new society , conventionally called the know - how society , producing a know - how economy , the core of which is conventionally called the know - how workforce .
welcome to the information technology in developing municipalities ( electronic municipalities ) seminar , which will start shortly with the participation of arab and foreign dignitaries and experts from canada , finland , jordan , muscat and lebanon .
the most important focal points to be discussed by the seminar are :
the first focal point : " introduction to electronic municipalities . "
the second focal point : " legal and legislative aspects and electronic financial transactions . "
the third focal point : " transformation from manual work to electronic work . "
the fourth focal point : " applied review of the working mechanism of an electronic municipality . "
we renew the pledge to our heroic martyrs and renew the pledge also to our resolute detainees in the israeli prisons , and we tell them that we will keep our pledge and that their cause is on top of the priority list of the palestinian authority and the fateh movement too , and we tell them that the dawn is coming soon , god willing .
on this occasion , we say that our people are subjected to the most vicious campaign ever witnessed by a people across history , a brutal aggression with the most modern of weapons . the magnificent steadfastness of this people is telling the whole world that we are a people who insist on their rights and who must have a place under the sun that is appropriate for it , for its struggle and for its sacrifices .
the loyal cadres of fateh , its men and knights were always up to the responsibilities thrown on their shoulders , and they were always renew the sacrifices and renew the resolve and the determination to stay the course of their leaders who passed along the way or still attempting martyrdom . the cadres of fateh and its knights are keeping the pledge .
we fully trust that the fateh movement is continually capable of renewing its sacrifices , of giving , of justice and equality among its cadres , and of spreading the democratic atmosphere within its ranks , and it is , god willing , on the verge of a new era after all this magnificent steadfastness and stalwart struggle which the masses of our people have gone through under the leadership of the fateh movement .
we tell our cadres to trust that the fateh movement is your movement , a movement of giving , a movement of strugglers , a movement not of those who get ahead , but of those who are sincere .
as for this tragic and excruciating situation our people are suffering and living through daily , we urge you our beloved ones , each one of you through his position , work and relationships , individually and collectively , to convey the just voice of your people and its just cause , and the war , aggression , violations and bloody incursions it is subjected to at the hands of the army of occupation and settlers , who are continuing to pillage , steal and annex our land and establishing more colonial settlement hotspots and expanding and enriching existing ones .
the israeli talk about vacating some of the settlement sites is just like throwing ashes in eyes to mislead the world public opinion .
all of this is taking place in a systematic fashion for the purpose of legitimizing and consolidating their occupation of our land and our holy sites , depriving our people from embodying their sacred rights to return , self - determination and the establishment of their palestinian state with jerusalem as its capital by transforming our areas into isolated , utterly disconnected " cantons " .
it is a much worse situation than the " apartheid " system , which was applied in south africa , not to mention the military and settlement roadblocks erected on streets , roads and mountain peaks , and at the entrances to every village , city and camp , the number of which has exceeded 750 roadblocks .
to you , for you , to the brotherly lebanese people and to his excellency president emile lahoud all greetings , respect and admiration .
you head out today in this popular march , which includes all of the lebanese parties and all of the sons of brotherly lebanon , to declare not only in your names and in the name of brotherly lebanon but in the names of all arab brothers and in the names of all of the free and honorable people in the whole world that the proud , gallant , and people of brotherly lebanon stand behind their brothers , the palestinian people in their just struggle against the occupation , against colonization , against the evil military escalation and against the daily crimes against our children , our women and our people , and against our infrastructure and our institutions , as well as against the wall of annexation , expansion and racial segregation .
in order for the palestinian people to win their freedom , independence and sovereignty in their independent palestinian state and its capital , holy jerusalem , god willing , and for the right of the palestinian refugees to return to their homeland , their land and their territories which they were expelled from by force and aggression , and for defending our christian and islamic holy sites as well as for the release of the heroic prisoners and detainees .
from here , and from the heart of the siege that is imposed on our palestinian people and on its legitimate leadership , i say to you - our beloved lebanese brothers - thank you from the heart and the soul .
on this historic day , the palestinian people and with them all of the honorable people in the world , are looking forward to hearing the verdict of international law , the verdict of human justice and the verdict of international legitimacy as the international court of justice convenes in the hague , in accordance with the resolution of the united nations general assembly , to voice its opinion on the issue of the construction of the wall of annexation , expansion and racial segregation israel is erecting on our palestinian land .
the culmination of this tragedy comes with the erection of this expansionist , occupational , colonial and racial wall , which has turned our cities , our villages and our camps into prisons and concentration camps . by what right do our people get deprived of their land and get imprisoned in these ghettos that the government of israel is erecting ?
at the same time , her occupying army and the settlers are practicing all forms of terrorism , aggression and murder against our people and land , destroying our entire infrastructure , bulldozing our agricultural land , our farms and our homes , taking control of our ground water and confiscating our tax and customs funds for more than three years so far !
and here are our people , the people of giants , being patient and steadfast despite these daily crimes which are being committed against them by the israeli occupation army , its tanks , guns , missiles and planes , as well as its internationally - banned weapons , and despite these inhumane and tragic conditions , which no other people in the entire world have experienced before .
as a matter of fact , the peace process has entered into a dark and extended tunnel after that , but we have maintained our correct vision of peace to serve our palestinian people , our arab nation and the entire region on the basis of the saudi initiative , which was adopted by the arab summit in beirut .
peace is surely in the interest of the palestinian people just as security and peace are surely in the interest of the israeli people , especially for the peace forces . from the people of moses there is a nation of people who preach fairness and rule with justice , and you have seen in the hague how rabbis and peace forces stood up and also in jerusalem and others , marched side by side with you against what is happening against the palestinian people .
our political position emanates from the interest of our people and from a deep understanding of facts and variables that , in turn , affect our palestinian situation , our arab situation and the situation of the entire arab world , and in the peace process in the whole region .
from here , we have insisted and today declare before our revolutionary council that the fateh movement insists on the option of a fair , permanent and comprehensive peace , on negotiations and on all legitimate international resolutions , the last of which is the road map , which today represents the international legitimacy with all of its active powers , and it also agreed to it according to the russian initiative now at the international security council .
the steadfast and vigilant palestinian people today observe and celebrate " international women 's day " on the eighth of march to affirm with strong , solid conviction and faith that the palestinian society rejects all forms of discrimination against women .
the only discrimination that our people sanction is positive discrimination in favor of women and for their full participation and empowerment to assume their genuine role in shaping national future , side by side with men and on equal footing in rights , duties and opportunities , which was affirmed by the palestinian declaration of independence document , as the palestinian woman is the protector of our existence and the eternal guardian of our bonfire .
palestinian women have made strides for total equality in the right to education and the right to work in all facets of life , as well as in all avenues of freedom and arenas of our people 's struggle , perseverance and steadfastness since the early twentieth century and in the face of " sykes - picot . "
women participate actively in public life , in association , societies and unions , and in various aspect s of struggling , political , cultural , educational , economic and social activities , and in decision - making on the national level , whether at the " palestinian national council " , the " central " or the " legislative council " , and in executive and leading activities in the " executive committee " and the " council of ministers " where there is a ministry for palestinian women affairs .
this , in turn , is an indication of society acknowledgment and recognition of the active role of women in the national decision - making process , paying full attention to women 's issues , and for eliminating any form of discrimination against them in full cooperation with the " general association of palestinian women " and various women activities and organizations .
i appeal to all democracy lovers in the world to help our people foster and renew its democratic life away from occupation , roadblocks , and wall of annexation , expansion and racial segregation , and we hereby affirm that the palestinian democracy and the independent state of palestine with holy jerusalem as its capital are the real guarantee for security , peace and good neighborliness between us and the israelis and throughout the whole region .
continuing the israeli occupation , persecution , killing , destruction , repression , building settlements , siege , roadblocks , and turning our land and cities into concentration camps will not build bridges of trust and will not provide the fertile ground for the establishment of real security and peace .
good neighborliness between the two peoples will not be achieved by building the wall of annexation , expansion and racial segregation , which , according to their maps , swallows 58% of our palestinian land and turns holy jerusalem , the capital of the state of palestine , and its christian and islamic holy sites into a ghetto surrounded by the wall and barbed and electronic wire , deprives the palestinians from entering their holy city , holy jerusalem , and praying at the al-aqsa mosque and the church of the nativity , and closes the historic and religious road to worshippers between holy jerusalem , bethlehem and the church of the nativity of our lord , the messiah , peace be upon him .
regarding what is happening in hebron and the ibrahimi mosque there , and what is happening in nablus and the historic old city , they do n't even respect their history ; our lord joseph and his father used to live there before they went to egypt . from jenin jarrad to rafah jarrad , in all of the bank and all of the gaza strip , the military escalation , destruction , assassinations and detentions according to their military plan , the so - called ( the outside game ) , which they announced officially and which started with the al-buraij and al-nussairat massacre , and yesterday in jenin . no one knows what will happen today and tomorrow , but here we are and there they are and time will be long .
brothers : the explosions in riyadh and the arrest of wanted people in enlightened medina and honored mecca and others that took place in the kingdom recently are matters that call for inquiry and thinking and for searching for the reasons why such acts take place . what are the components of their motivations ?
how could there be ideas and directions that are absolutely incompatible with the reality of a homeland which has enacted god 's law for its way and has chosen god 's book and the teachings of his prophet as a constitution that rules the talk and the deed .
were what we witnessed of criminal acts committed by young citizens who targeted the people for death , the properties for destruction and the families for terrorizing ?
was the source of that a thought that originated from this land , an imported thought , or a product of temptation of a bunch whose minds have not matured yet , or was it due to many reasons belonging to many parties inside and outside , and what is the degree of strength and dissemination of such thought ?
these questions , brothers , and others are the ones for which answers should be sought when looking at the problem of those who disobeyed the nation in its straight path , chose the path of the devil and deviated from righteousness .
the problem in my opinion or my view does not lie with a criminal act committed by a criminal as a result of criminal desires or inclinations , but it is much bigger than that ; it is a problem of convictions . if wrong is committed out of conviction of its correctness , the roots must be sought , the roots of forming convictions , building beliefs and formulating directions .
as we open the proceedings of the eighth legislative session of your esteemed council , i would like to offer my heart - felt congratulations for the precious trust which the citizens of various social affiliations have bestowed upon you to true representatives for them as guardians of their interests , the interests of the homeland , its future and its destiny .
it also pleases me to congratulate you for the fortieth anniversary of the glorious eighth of march revolution that has produced the blessed corrective movement , which made and kept a promise to convene the first people 's council in thirty two years , followed by regular legislative sessions , embodying in a pragmatic way the democracy emanating from our heritage and which is fitting our situation .
the past seven sessions thus achieved a lot of work in the areas of legislation and monitoring and passed many laws with which we have accomplished great progress on all fronts .
regardless of any academic or scientific definition for the meaning of revolution , such as a fundamental change of something or a total transformation in the direction of history , the real revolution to me is the on - going reality that follows such a fundamental change , which is a continuous state of development and progress for the better .
the industrial revolution , for instance , was not limited to one day , to days or to several years .
also , the digital revolution , which emerged in the eighties , is still continuing till this day and with great thrust .
celebrating a certain day is a symbol of such change , but development and progress are the continuation of that day .
madam president , we warmly welcome you to chair this session .
this interest reflects your personal desire and the desire of your friendly country , chile , to confront the big challenges that face future generations and to tame them .
so , we welcome you .
we would like to offer our thanks to the executive director of the united nations children 's organization , carol bellamy , and the special representative of the secretary - general , otunno olara , for their valuable statements at the beginning of this session .
we affirm that their substance contributes to moving forward to face the challenge represented by the problem of children 's suffering during armed conflicts .
my delegation has reviewed the secretary - general 's report put forward before us , and we believe it should enjoy the attention of all of us .
i would like at the outset , madam president , to express the appreciation of egypt 's delegation to you and to your friendly country and for chairing this important session , and i would also like to offer thanks to the secretary - general and his special representative , mr. olara otunno , for their valuable efforts and contributions to bolstering and protecting children 's rights during armed conflicts .
i would also like to praise the efforts of mrs. carol bellamy , the executive director of the united nations children 's fund ( unicef ) , in the areas of bolstering and protecting the rights of the child and to affirm my country 's total commitment to support all efforts that are being exerted in this regard .
the council has been paying special attention for many years to the issue of refugee and internally - displaced children who were forced to flee their countries , and also the children who were recruited for sexual exploitation , putting special emphasis on young girls since they are more vulnerable to additional risks , especially sexual violence .
it is a thankful effort by the council which my country supports and hopes for its continuation .
but i would like here to draw the attention of the esteemed council to a group of children that have been forgotten , children under foreign occupation , especially the children in the occupied palestinian territories , who are dying daily as a result of continuing violations of their human rights and the brutal use of force .
it is enough to look quickly at the number of children victims resulting from the on - going conflict to realize the importance of dealing with this issue directly and shedding light on it .
allow me to offer thanks for convening this open session and for giving the opportunity once again to member countries to voice their opinions and express their concerns toward addressing the issue of trade in illegal small arms and light arms .
we also offer thanks to mr. secretary - general for the report presented in this regard .
i shall not forget to offer thanks and appreciation to mr. abe , the under - secretary - general for disarmament affairs , for his presentation of the secretary - general 's report .
the united nations conference affirmed in the year 2001 that the problem of illegal trade in small and light arms is a complex and extremely difficult problem in view of the threat it poses to innocent life , especially among children , women and the elderly who were victims of such arms , which caused us to call on all countries , especially the manufacturing and exporting countries of such arms , to make every possible effort through international cooperation to stop this tragedy and find effective solutions for it .
the catastrophic dimensions of the small and light arms issue have become evident in the conflicts that have been and are still being witnessed by some countries of the african continent and other regions which are witnessing similar conflicts .
on this occasion , we re - iterate our demand to all countries to respect the embargo resolutions that the united nations resolutions imposed on exporting small arms and light arms to the african countries , which are witnessing armed conflicts .
it pleases me to welcome among us in this meeting mr. jose ramos - horta , the foreign minister of timor - leste .
we wish him , his government and his people all success in building their emerging country .
it pleases me to express our thanks to the secretary - general of the united nations , mr. kofi anan , for his special report on the united nations support mission in timor - leste and also to mr. jean - marie kamalesh sharma , the special representative of the secretary - general in timor - leste , who deserves all appreciation .
the special report of the secretary - general comprehensively reviews all important developments which timor - leste has witnessed since gaining independence , the accomplishments that were realized in the area of reconstruction and the challenges that are still existing there .
allow us to confirm the truth of what was reported in many of the statements that were read and which indicated that timor - leste is one of the united nations success stories due to the relentless follow - up which was realized as a result of the efforts of the general assembly and its special commission for eradicating colonialism , the work that the security council has embarked upon , or the efforts the general - secretariat of the united nations has made .
syria 's delegation supports what the report said that the political institutions in timor - leste continued to develop and that the progress that was achieved is admirable .
thank you , mr. president , for convening this session .
we congratulate you for taking on the chairmanship of the council for this month , and we wish you all success .
we thank chile 's delegation for its successful leadership of the council 's proceedings last month .
my delegation thanks the secretary - general for his provisional report regarding the recommendations prepared by the security council 's mission sent to central africa and which my delegation has had the honor of participating in .
the report put forward before the council proves the importance of the missions sent by the council to conflict regions , which carry added importance when later coupled with quick action to implement the recommendations that will be arrived at .
my delegation is satisfied for implementing a big part of the recommendations of the mission which visited central africa during the period from 7 to 16 of june 2003 .
particularly , those related to establishing the transitional institutions in the democratic republic of the congo in a number of important and critical areas , especially naming the transitional government 's members from the eight sides and entities that participated in the dialogue between the congolese sides , and the adoption of the council of ministers of a comprehensive set of public policy objectives , including the formation of an integrated national army and an integrated national police force .
the provisional report by the secretary - general regarding the achieved progress in implementing the recommendations of the united nations mission sent to the central africa region comes to reflect a fact the egyptian delegation would like to highlight before the security council and which is : despite the existence of evidence for moving the situation in both the democratic republic of the congo and burundi in a positive direction , the challenges facing the restoration of peace in its comprehensive sense for those two countries , and to the great lakes region in general , are still momentous .
more effort must be continued to be made in order to meet them .
in this regard , our delegation would like to point out the following remarks :
first , it is very important to acknowledge that dealing with the post - conflict era in the central africa region requires " participation " between the transitional governments , the united nations , the concerned regional and international powers , the african union , the sub - regional organizations and the community of international donors .
such " participation " must be based on the principle of " integrating and balancing the responsibilities " between the partners .
we do have now a clear vision for the needs and requirements for the stages of making , keeping and building the peace in the region , which are needs and requirements that exceed the limited security meaning of peace to a wider list of interrelated and intertwined political , human , economic and social factors , which require finding an integrated package of aid , incentives and pressures that may be difficult to translate into a practical reality without achieving such desired " participation . "
the issue of " national reconciliation in the post armed - conflicts era " takes on an obvious importance in the context of debating the future role of the united nations in the areas of making , keeping and building peace .
the polarization of the national reconciliation element cannot be underestimated in rehabilitating societies that had suffered the agony of armed conflicts and their reflections on the social fabric and the economic structure in concerned countries and regions , and enabling them to put the past behind and look forward to a future of peaceful coexistence , cooperation and appreciation for the unity of purpose and interests .
in our estimation , talking about the united nations role in national reconciliation processes must take into consideration a number of issues and factors as follows :
first , national reconciliation processes are considered long - range in nature whereas the major part falls within the context of " peace - building " , although the process of piecing together the institutional skeletons to manage them begins at an early period of the " peace - keeping " phase .
while features of the direct role of the united nations in the area of peace - keeping are developing in accordance with the " brahimi commission 's " report , the organization 's role in the area of peace - building still needs more characterization and guidance so that the practical connotation of united nations contributions in the area of national reconciliation can be identified .
second , the requirements and components of the national reconciliation processes vary according to the nature of the conflict under consideration , and the historical , cultural , social , political and economic dimensions related to the breakout of such conflict .
mr. president , we thank you for convening this meeting to review the provisional report of the secretary - general regarding the achieved progress in implementing the recommendations of the united nations mission sent to west africa , in which syria has had the honor to participate .
we also express our appreciation for assistant secretary - general mr. kalomoh for presenting the provisional report of the secretary - general in which it discusses steps taken or will be taken to implement the recommendations of the security council mission to guinea - bissau , the ivory coast , liberia and sierra leone .
our delegation is satisfied for the return of tranquility to guinea - bissau and the pledge by the provisional president and the provisional government to hold legislative elections within the period specified in the provisional charter or prior to that date in accordance with the recommendation of the national election commission .
we add our voice to the voice of the secretary - general that the need is urgent for the involvement of the international community to provide financial and other support to allow local authorities to implement their commitments .
as for côte d'avoire , we agree with the secretary - general that the linas - marcoussis agreements must be implemented as soon as possible by all sides , according to what the council 's mission , which was sent to the region , recommended , in addition to what it recommended in paragraph 31 of its report .
our delegation expresses satisfaction for the implementation of some of these recommendations by president gbagbo , prime minister diarra and the new forces provisionally and sequentially .
i promise to adhere to the five minutes allocated for each speaker , even if i had to stop reading from the written text of my statement .
i would like , mr. president , to speak about a number of points as an egyptian comment on the provisional report presented by the secretary - general regarding the achieved progress in implementing the recommendations of the united nations mission sent to west africa .
first , the interest in supporting the cooperation and raising the capabilities of the economic group of the west africa countries comes as a cornerstone in the sub - regional debate on the issue of security and peace in this region .
no doubt , the group has presented a commendable model for the african self - abilities in the areas of peace - making and keeping it in recent years , starting with sierra leone , through guinea - bissau and cote d'avoire and ending with liberia .
despite the limited technical and marketing resources available to them .
we agree with what the report included about the need to find an effective format for helping the group bypass the hurdles facing it in the direction of continuing their exceptional performance in preventing and settling armed conflicts and keeping the peace .
i would like to offer my sincere thanks to all of the delegates which supported the draft resolution related to giving aid to the palestinian people and which was adopted a short while ago by more than an overwhelming majority .
we also would like to express our thanks to the countries that adopted and presented this important project to the general assembly .
i would also like to express our appreciation and gratitude in this regard to all donor countries , united nations agencies , regional commissions and non - governmental organizations which generously gave humane and other aid to the palestinian people in the occupied palestinian territories , including east jerusalem .
our people , who are still living under very difficult conditions that are nearing a humane disaster , feels immense gratitude to all of them .
at the same time , needless to say that most of the aid comes as humane aid instead of aid for economic development , and that is , for the most part , due to the horrible conditions created for the palestinian people by the occupation power .
consequently , the urgent issue is to change these conditions in a way that allows a process of real economic development .
allow me to state some of our remarks on the issue put forward before us today :
first , the effectiveness of the security council and its credibility do not only come from being the mechanism accepted by the world for more than half a century to maintain international peace and security , but also from its embarking on facing the new challenges to peace and security at the regional and international levels , its interaction with and adaptation in facing them .
based on this , the council 's realization of the seriousness of the issue of illegal trade and proliferation of small arms and light arms and their human consequences in recent years forces the council to act to face this challenge with such seriousness and effectiveness commensurate with the immensity of the danger resulting from it .
second , the interaction between the security council and the general assembly is indispensable for addressing the issues related to illegal proliferation of small arms and light arms and for formulating and implementing an effective , long - range strategy to face them .
in this regard , the general assembly accomplished a thankful progress by its recommendation at the end of december 2003 to form an open - membership working group to study and formulate an international document to brand and monitor illegal small arms and light arms .
we hope that the work of this group during the years 2004 - 2005 will be crowned with the desired success in order to arrive at perfecting international cooperation to prevent and eradicate the illegal trade in small arms and light arms .
mr. president , we wanted to participate in today 's session because of our belief in the importance of on - going and continuing dialogue in various united nations circles over the threats international terrorism poses to aspects of international community life , including its peace , security , development and its economic and social progress , which requires joining the wills of all countries to face it and assures wide international involvement to fight all aspects of this danger .
allow me to make the following points , which we think are fundamental in our discussion today :
first , the issue of terrorism strongly forced itself on the agenda of the united nations proceedings as a world threat that does not distinguish between countries , peoples , religions or cultures .
egypt has been and still is among the first countries to affirm that terrorism is an international phenomenon , and thus , confronting it requires a collective and balanced action that avoids unilateral measures and instigating the animosity of cultures , civilizations or religions .
second , the anti - terrorism commission has managed in the past two years to affirm once again that the united nations with its various services has the ability to stand up decisively and effectively to the growing international threats .
with this backdrop , egypt was quick to cooperate with the commission and provide it with the reports , which so far total three reports .
