the supposed ( and coercive ) " brothers " continue their claims of silencing those who are taking their place and closing their ears to their articles
they are delusional , or they delude themselves , that french muslims are either incapable of islam or powerless .
they need sheikh ahmad al zein , " sunni " religious judge ( al hanafi al shafi ' ) in sidon , or those like him , ( " al hayat on the 6th of this month ) to reinstate their right to reason , science or to will and power .
perhaps that is the essence of the issue and the matter .
" counselor " al hudeibi , sheikh yousef al qardawi , sheikh rashid qabbani , " sheikh " mohammad khatami , sheikh mohammad hussein fadlallah and sheikh ahmad kaftaro , and others who think like them , consider that muslims , born or converted , are muslims whose creed and belief , and the matter of guardianship of the creed and belief , is not their business , meaning not the business of the muslims themselves , but a matter that should be left to the clerics themselves and the people of religious opinion .
the media reported what his eminence sheikh sayyed tantawi , al azhar sheikh , god favor us and him , stated with regard to the french government banning head scarves by muslim women when going to school , and his eminence 's statement that this is the right of the french government . he said : " if the muslim woman is in a non - muslim country , such as france for example , and officials want to pass laws that are contradictory to the issue of head scarves for muslim women , that is their right .
that is their right .
that is their right , and i repeat their right that i cannot object to . " ( " al hayat on 12/31/2003 ) .
the reality is that when i read what his eminence the sheikh of al azhar said i was very surprised by it .
he is a dignified islamic persona , and his position has great weight all over the world .
i have met him more than once , including my visiting him in his office , in the month of november 1997 , where he included us with his gentle morals and eminent treatment , and we benefited from his point of view in the issues discussed , which exhibit deep knowledge .
for that we were greatly surprised by the said statement .
the strong growth witnessed by the private sector last year was associated with several factors that led to the enhancement of trust in the national economy , which are expected to reflect positively on the growth rate of the private sector for the current year as well .
among these factors were : the decrease in interest rates of deposits in local currencies to agree with low interest rates on the dollar , allowing the local and foreign private sector to invest in natural gas production projects and electricity and water projects , and privatizing a part of the shares of " saudi communications " company .
the performance of the saudi stock market was good last year , and the market index rose by 76.2 percent , supported by the low prices of local interest rates and high cash flow levels , in addition to the return of some saudi capital from abroad and the good results of listed saudi companies .
it is expected that government expenditure in the year 2004 will also exceed expected levels in the budget , meaning the government will follow the same expansionist financial policy it followed last year . that will lead to a 2 percent growth in the government sector , while the saudi private sector is expected to grow 4 percent , supported by low interest rates and excessive cash flow volumes .
the growth of non - oil sectors , whether government or private , will compensate for the negative growth expected for the oil sector , with the total growth rate of the national product in steady prices reaching 2 percent this year .
after kuwait achieved a growth in the gross national product , in steady prices of approximately 1 percent in the year 2002 , this growth rose to approximately 4 percent last year .
do iraqi secularists realize that the united states , for a long time , took advantage of the factors of backwardness produced by the humiliating subordination to the west 's ideals - specifically secularism - for which some call among themselves ?
and that it depicted them as factors of weakness in the people of the arab and islamic region that can be utilized to control the " middle east " region , and take its natural resources ?
therefore , specialized american study centers seek to offer research that depicts the " third world " as not having a scientific mind capable of investing its natural resources , especially oil .
the evidence is abundant for those who want it .
this policy is characterized by dominance , greed and interest .
it is an old policy in western thought that started when socrates and his two students plato and aristotle tried to theorize the philosophy of dominance and control of the other through the call for the supremacy of the western being who is the basis of all dominance .
therefore the famous economist adam smith said honestly : " if every ( western ) individual followed his individual interest , general affluence would be certain . "
the demand by the iraqi kurdish leadership for federacy , before free elections all over iraq , is decisive evidence that the kurdish leadership fears the will of the kurdish people , and not the minorities that are within what is called iraqi kurdistan .
the evidence on that is that this leadership did not conduct elections in iraqi kurdistan , for 12 years , despite the possibility of that annually .
what did the government of kurdistan offer the kurdish people , except fighting among the tribes of al barazani and al talbani at the expense of kurdish blood ?
they have traded with this blood for 40 years .
as is familiar , when fighting erupts between al barazani and al talbani , it does not stop until a third party intervenes .
and as is known , this permanent peace between them came late before the american arbitrator .
if fighting erupts among them , inside the borders of their federacy , who will interfere between them to stop the bleeding of the kurdish people 's blood ?
the economic scene for most egyptians since the liberation decision until now has been effective in view of the conviction that any crisis can be treated or severely reduced , except the " trust crisis " , which if it escalates , will return to its normal state easily . the current atmosphere is a fertile land to achieve that , in view of the hiding of current circumstances and allowing the citizen to seriously determine priorities .
but both sides , the citizen and the government , must take into consideration the result of the " bilateral boycott " that has not been presented at the street level since the bread crisis of the year 1977 .
each government has its problems and crises but in the end it has incubated citizens since the government of mamdouh salem in the early seventies , passing through the governments of fouad muhiddin , kamal hasan ali , ali lutfi , atef sidqi and kamal al janzouri .
but the current government is viewed by citizens with scorn , as if it were the cause of their concerns , complaints and pain despite the fact that the citizen himself represents a large part of these concerns .
the population problem is increasing , the method of thinking about life is deteriorating and the demand for life 's luxuries is increasing without looking at the nature and value of the income .
most citizens agree that the tone of boredom and restlessness interacts in view of the clear failure in treating the crisis of price hikes that is constantly increasing without a parallel in the income of citizens , keeping in mind that prices have increased by 40 percent on average from early july 2003 until now .
despite the repeated and decisive directives of president husni mubarak on the necessity of alleviating the situation of citizens and condensing meetings with the economic group , the government is dealing with the resolutions without correct implementation , which prompted some to finally demand the intervention of the party to cooperate with the government to set solutions .
mr. jihad al khazen ( " al hayat " on 1/22/2004 ) was decisive when he nullified the latest libyan decision to remove weapons of mass destruction on the pretext that its timing was inappropriate , and that it resulted in pressures on countries such as egypt , syria and iran .
the aforementioned determined that the decision was merely giving in to the american policy of sticks , offering as evidence the recent declaration by some american officials the feasibility of the policy of sticks that was used in dealing with afghanistan and iraq in libya making its latest decision .
he offered a number of made - up events and disfigured statements to prove that there is israeli - libyan closeness lurking on the horizon .
finally , he did not miss creating trouble , and tried to hint that the aid of colonel al qadhafi to palestinians only went to extremist palestinian factions .
he ridiculed the libyan leadership , deciding it aided egypt in imposed visas on egyptians entering libya like it helped palestinians before by expelling them to the borders .
the latest libyan decision to remove weapons of mass destruction and its timing are matters that concern libya alone .
it knows best what agrees with its interests , and what conflicts with them .
when talk centers around the reduction and abatement in the israeli prevention power becomes a main constituent in the public comments of the israeli government and its branches , the matter requires caution and care of new adventures sharon , mofaz and their chiefs of staff might undertake to rehabilitate the deteriorating israeli psychology and the prevention power afflicted in its heart .
palestinians must first take that into consideration that , despite the fact that israel made them a field of experiments , and tried all its weapons against them . the palestinian leadership must be careful , and people and factions must be careful .
" hizbollah " , its leadership and the entire country of lebanon must be careful of the release of this " wounded beast " .
syria and its leadership must be careful of newer , more brutal and deeper raids on syrian territories .
palestinian faction leaders must be careful .
in all cases , even if you accept the opinion of the iraqi foreign minister as it is , the return to the past does not do any good . what is required is to get out of the current political and security crises , and reinstate iraq 's independence .
i have spoke to mr. allawi and heard him without agreeing , with my appreciation of the ability of his character and his morals .
here i find myself once again in disagreement with the interim council . it includes in my personal opinion seven members or eight nationalists whose nationalism is not in their nationalism , among them specifically adnan bachachi , whom i mention as president of the interim council this month .
but there is a majority in brokers and opportunists who returned to iraq onboard an american tank , and those work for themselves not for the good of iraq and iraqis .
some members of the interim council know they will be finished if elections are conducted and so they are opposed to conducting them . the reader needs no more than to follow the proposals of some council members , such as the proposal to expand it and replace it with the proposed national assembly .
exactly a year ago , powell presented the horror scenario at the security council by declaring " huge " quantities of biological and chemical weapons owned by iraq , and relations between the iraqi regime and the " al qaeda " network .
he spoke about baghdad working to own nuclear weapons and the presence of huge quantities of elements such as " anthrax " and nerve gas .
that day colin powell turned to a front of falcons who set the scenario of war before finding its justifications . he presented the scenario of terror on their behalf at the international assembly .
this week powell spoke with two tongues : we doubted he would have the same position supporting the war on iraq if he had been told the country did not own a weapons of mass destruction arsenal .
he stressed that the invasion of iraq was " the correct decision " justifying the invasion due to iraqi 's " intentions " and abilities to make weapons of mass destruction and the dangers of its regime - regardless of its weapons stock .
colin powell is a " soldier " committed to loyalty , and he is a secretary of state in an administration who president wants to be reelected .
he is relatively pardoned , even if history will reproach him later .
what are merely lies in america are transformed to bombing on the heads of people outside , an endless war , and a continued saga called " pax americana " .
the matter is not related to the secret of politics as it seems to intelligent writers , such as christopher hutchins , who move from left to right with the movement of the center of weight of the intelligentsia from left to right , and with the transformation towards identity policies in the third world , and with the extinction of the mutual cosmic language with the democratic powers in the west .
hutchins believes that the " wise " keeping the secret and knowing the true goal of the war that cannot be said without handling , amendments , maneuvering and weaving stories makes the game attractive to the intelligent people , like wolfowitz .
the truth is what makes the writing of christopher hutchins attractive , but there is no more to it than that .
it is also a consumption of scandals and secret , but it is an elegant consumption for the elite .
politics are not run this way .
the dreamer politicians and monopolizers of ready facts , such as new governors , use political maneuvering and misleading of the goal they believe is noble .
mr. ali al sistani held on to an american promise by its collar and stuck to it , which is the promise to establish democracy and conduct elections on which a democratic system would be established .
with this position , he is helping the americans and members of the interim council to be serious .
it is the first test for the credibility of the promise of democracy for the region .
mr. al sistani had taken his first step , as a reference for a religious majority in iraq , by demanding that an elected committee write a new constitution .
with this , he has not departed from what all the iraqis are seeking . nor has he gone outside the democratic frameworks the americans seek to establish in iraq .
the constitution is an expression of an internal state despite the universality of constitutions today .
in this sense , the constitution must not displease anyone , thus making him go beyond his peaceful nature to demand his rights . constitutions are a guarantee against the eruption of violence , a guarantee for peaceful deliberation and for the stability of the state and the society , as is the case in the constitutions of prevalent democracies .
al sistani took his second democratic step after the announcement of the date and method for the transfer of authority to the interim council , which is what the united states means by " iraqis " .
but , suspicions soon spread that there is a premeditated intention to bypass the will of the iraqi people and register the emerging democracy in the name of the interim council alone or those famous for their loyalty to it and to americans directly .
legislative development has been great and momentous , but it is to be observed that , in europe , this legislative development comes in the footsteps of the interpretations of the courts and seeks to consecrate this scrutiny , while in the arab countries this development comes to force the courts to change their directions , but the courts remain unconquerable .
the judiciary in the arab countries is still under the impression that arbitration does not remove its competence , but removes its authority !
this incapacitates the effect the legislators have sought when they amended arbitration laws . it leads to international arbitrations distancing themselves from the arab countries and going to the european countries , where the judiciary is keen on protecting the freedom to conclude contracts and the freedom of arbitration .
but what do you observe in the arab countries ?
saudi arabia : religious courts , after the issuance of the new saudi arbitration law , still consider that the arbitration stipulation does not remove their competence , and they proceed with a lawsuit despite the arbitration stipulation and in spite of the adherence of one of the parties in the conflict to the arbitration .
it is a matter that goes back one step and moves forward two steps , and has not been resolved until now despite the explicitness of the modern saudi arbitration law that recognizes the arbitration stipulation .
syria : an international arbitration verdict was issued between the " stahl e gistel and alloys " company ( swiss ) and the syrian " public company for fertilizers " , which is a government company .
the scene carried out on the screens was expressive .
abdul qadir khan , the father of the pakistani nuclear bomb , came to president pervez musharraf and put the case in his hands .
he presented the president with a bomb as a gift , from the damages of which it is difficult for the president to survive .
in his military jacket , musharraf seemed flabbergasted and confused .
what khan said was dangerous , very dangerous .
he simply confessed to the other aspect .
he swam long in the nuclear black market .
he entered the bazaar and went far .
he leaked secrets and information to iran , libya and north korea .
musharraf 's looks were reflecting how precarious his situation was .
he knows that the pakistanis love this man more than him .
they look at him as the hero who liberated the fearful pakistan from its old complex towards india .
he gave that troubled country , that was born out of a bloody divorce , a feeling of security , and a feeling that it will not be threatened or be vulnerable after today .
he gave it a feeling of strength and dignity .
the " fateh " movement was born 39 years ago .
its first bullet protected the cause from oblivion and drew the landmarks of the path .
but the world in which it was born is no longer exists .
and the conflict it was involved in has witnessed changes and transformations .
therefore , it is not strange that it becomes confused after all these turns .
and it is not strange that it witnesses the submission of resignations and the levying of accusations .
no one can deny the role of " fateh " .
no one can deny the role of yasser arafat .
but it is the right of every supporter of the palestinian cause to question whether the " fateh " leadership , before the external and internal challenges , has taken all the decisions that ought to be taken .
no names of prominent leaders were included in the resignation letter submitted by 400 mid - level fateh cadres .
but the letter , in one of its sections , indicates the size of the confusion that pervades the movement , whose role cannot be dispensed within the confrontation or negotiation with israel .
the signatories said the movement has started to corrode from the inside due to internal contradictions .
i sit awaiting democracy . if it does not come the american way , it is inevitable that it will come to us the english way .
for days i followed the visit of the foreign minister of libya , mr. abdurrahman shalgham to britain . i noticed that , when he was asked in a press conference about the killing of policewoman , yvonne fletcher , at the libyan embassy in london in 1984 , he answered quoting former british spy david shyler about the attempt of the british intelligence to assassinate colonel muammar gaddafi .
thus , britain and libya have come out even , a murder for an attempted murder . it remains for me to hear the opinion of policewoman fletcher on the silence of the british foreign ministry regarding this subject .
before that , the united states and britain had proposed to the arab leaders to follow in the footsteps of the brother colonel .
i imagine that what was meant was that they should follow his footsteps in strip - teasing and leave israel alone as a nuclear , chemical and biological power in the middle east .
this point must be clarified so that no one comes out believing that what is required is to go gradually from killing the opposition and a british policewomen to terrorist operations , downing two civilian aircraft , kidnapping civilians , and other such acts , culminating in the abandonment of weapons of mass destruction , which were only present in the imagination of the democratically - renovated libyan leader .
i will not bother the reader with an entire article about libya . i only want to add some aspects of democracy we have yet to enjoy in the middle east .
iran goes to elections today to come back a loser .
a quarter century ago , al khumeini 's theses attracted people .
they supported them and took to the streets .
they cheered and waved their fists .
the state of the shah tumbled .
the army disintegrated , and with it the " savak " , and the entire machine of repression and oppression .
a quarter of a century after the victory of the revolution through the people , the revolution regime goes to elections afraid of them .
the matter is not related to the future of mohammad khatami .
it was not a secret from the start that he is a president in the era of the guide .
the matter is related to the future of the regime , the revolution and the country .
the recent weeks revealed the amount of fear facing the extremists , who were worried about the infiltration of the winds into the castle of the revolution .
they could no longer withstand the dance of democracy , despite the controls and breaks provided by the constitution .
the last word given by the constitution to the guide was no longer enough to reassure them .
despite everything that marred his behavior , including hesitance and a tendency for reconciliation , concessions and coexistence , mohammad khatami planted worrying questions in the body of the regime .
poor paul bremer .
his suffering exceeds his ability to endure .
he has been charged with arranging what is difficult to arrange and market what is impossible to market .
the iraqis did not believe he came on a humanitarian mission and that his obsession was to make a beautiful future for them .
skepticism , as is boredom and anger , is a habit of the iraqis .
poor man , his mission is tiring .
the joy of overthrowing saddam did not last long .
the iraqi people have gone back to their main ingredients .
dialogue with " the sunni triangle " is impossible .
appeasing the kurdish allies is difficult , because it angers allies and friends inside iraq and abroad .
he speaks to the shiites in the interim council and they point with their fingers to al najaf .
the man sitting in al najaf does not receive him , but prefers the united nations over the united states .
his job is exhausting .
time is running out .
it is no use digging up the recent past .
and there is no use renewing the controversy over the feasibility of the american war on iraq and waging it without an international mandate and the principle of pre - emptive war .
that is why george bush discussed with his guest , gerhard schroeder , the present and the future , and they overlooked the petty differences of the recent past .
it would have been in the interest of the american president to refute the claims of the democrats , that the way he is managing foreign policy made the united states lose european allies , including germany , who are playing a role on the ground in afghanistan .
bush realizes that he will need the " naughty " europeans to encourage the united nations to play a role in iraq that will make it easy for the united states to end the occupation , and afterwards to conduct elections and build institutions .
he will also need the naughty europeans in any possible role for the north atlantic alliance .
because it is election season , the leader of the white house has sent out signals that reflect his magnanimity .
american secretary of defense , james schlesinger , called in the british ambassador to washington , lord cromer , and informed him that the united states would not tolerate a threat from a state that is " backward and little populated " and that he no longer ruled out that the united states would use force .
he ruled out other possibilities , such as replacing current obstinate arab leaders with " cooperative leaders " , or threatening with gun boat diplomacy .
the ban announced by the arab opec member states was aimed at pressuring the united states and the other western countries to force them to withdraw from arab lands . it lasted until march 1973 and the united states lost only 13 percent of its imported oil , but that created major difficulties for it .
schlesinger estimated that the operation at the beginning will need two army brigades , one for the arab kingdom of saudi arabia and the other for kuwait , and perhaps a third for the emirate of abu dhabi , with the help of britain .
that was 30 years ago . but today 's news , all of which is published and true , include :
the kingdom of saudi arabia now produces approximately eight million barrels of unrefined oil daily and it can increase that to ten million . it intends to maintain an average production of about 5.1 million barrels until the year 2011 .
it is the right of anyone following developments in iraq to wonder if there is a string that links together the bloody stabs that have been directed at various parties .
he has the right to ask whether the string linking the explosions and assassinations targeting religious or political symbols is drowning the field in a bloody mess that extinguishes the hope for the establishment of an iraqi authority capable of providing security and stability .
it is also possible to wonder whether the explosions are aimed at shaking the stability of the entire region through the poisons that can be triggered by the creation of bloody contact lines between the main components of the iraqi people .
that is without forgetting an important question , which is whether iraq has turned into merely a zone for wars larger than itself , especially the war launched by those who targeted by the " war on terrorism " that was triggered immediately after september 11 , 2001 .
it is obvious that yesterday 's massacre was aimed at igniting the fire .
selecting the scenes for the crime and the methods of implementation only aimed at launching a series of reactions that would lead to drowning iraq in a hellish cycle , out of which it is difficult to emerge .
because the strife is at this level of danger , the iraqis would rather crystallize a reaction that goes beyond the advice of the wise and the statements of condemnation and denunciation .
the iraqis did not accuse the american forces of involvement in the explosions that bloodied karbala and baghdad the day before yesterday .
in the first place , the americans have no interest in taking part in an act of that kind .
such an involvement means pushing the large shiite mass into becoming involved in the armed resistance .
it is an involvement that can ignite the land of iraq under the feet of occupation .
on the contrary , the american administration seemed , in the last months , to imply that the reverberating strikes that were targeted at " coalition forces " , international headquarters and religious symbols are the work of the resistance coming from the outside .
the massacres of the day before yesterday help support what the americans are seeking to promote , as it is difficult to believe that what happened serves the agenda of any iraqi group .
the iraqis did not accuse the americans , especially after it became clear that suicide attacks contributed in the massacres of karbala and baghdad .
but iraqi parties accused the americans of falling short of taking the responsibilities that they should shoulder as an occupying force .
they accused them of dereliction in security procedures .
the truth is that it is hard to imagine a security situation under occupation , even if it had set a date to end the occupation .
it is difficult to combine occupation and security , especially in this country , and specifically in this region .
from today until the summit of the eight , there will be much talk about the " greater middle east initiative " , which is based on the greater middle east partnership .
this put the wagon behind the horse , for it presupposes cooperation between the middle east countries and israel , with the latter continuing its killing and destruction , as if the palestinians were from another world and as if their plight did not concern arabs and muslims in the region .
i want to make a point of skepticism , for which i have no evidence , except that i know who writes the american projects , the sharonists - likudists in and around the american administration , who are loyal only to israel .
the point is that the goal of the greater middle east is to bring in turkey , iran , afghanistan and pakistan in order to make the arabs a minority within the project .
but , what the authors of these projects ignore , because of their israeli blindness , is that the muslims might be more supportive of the palestinians than the arabs . ask any turk , pakistani , iranian or afghani about their opinions in the matter .
in any case , the greater middle east initiative is largely based on the arab human development report for the years 2002 and 2003 .
the report had spoken about three " deficiencies " , in freedom , knowledge and the empowerment of women . the initiative spoke about three needs , which are promoting democracy , building a knowledgeable society , and expanding economic opportunities .
america is a big problem .
its friendship is costly and its enmity is exorbitant .
it is impossible for states today to live as if america does not exist .
it is inevitably necessary for the issuance of an international good behavior certificate .
it must approve the impartiality of elections and good management of the economy .
it must sign the government 's record in the field of human rights .
it is necessary to break into the gifts of the international monetary fund and the world bank .
it is futile to seek the help of the security council if it does not approve .
the reports of its envoys are important and usually decisive .
without the presence of and awe from its military machine , slobodan milosevic would not be sitting behind bars .
and without the heavy weight of the same machine , saddam hussein would be living in a castle waving the new " mother of battles " .
america is indispensable for stopping a civil war and encouraging the president to take the path of exile .
when ramon does not find what to lie about , he seeks the help of others . in one episode , he quotes american secretary of defense donald rumsfeld as saying that tehran had helped al qaeda and the taliban by facilitating the escape of their men through iran .
through iran to where ?
rumsfeld 's statement was issued in january 2002 , and we know now that each charge directed by the american administration before the war on iraq was a lie .
on the subject of iran specifically , it almost waged a war against the taliban after its diplomats and citizens were killed in afghanistan , and nothing links them at all with al qaeda and taliban .
but ramon continues the lie , quoting an article written by michael evans in the " times " about an official in al qaeda , who offered to move its elements into lebanon .
israel hopes that , and sends people to promote its untrue wishes , but that has not happened and it will not happen .
the booklet ends with what israel really wants and ramon proposes , which is political and military pressure on syria and iran to stop supporting hizbollah . he seems confused in a previous chapter ; for once he says that syria 's support is more important , and at another time he says that iran 's support is the most important .
perhaps , spanish socialist leaders do not like to hear any skepticism about the ideological or value dimension of the rivalry that was started by the war on iraq , especially with regard to the french position .
the spaniards , from right to left , especially the left , admit that spain had large interests in saddam hussein 's iraq , which , of course , were not of the same volume as that of the huge french interests during the old era .
likewise , they , especially the right , admit that america has been applying dual standards for a long time in iraq , especially during the eighties .
in discussions with the concerned spaniards , the intensity of the political and cultural dimensions in the rivalry basically sometimes reduces the essence of the rivalry over foreign policy ( between france and germany , on one hand , and washington on the other ) to a conflict of interests .
but he who wanders , not only among spanish institutions , but also in the streets of madrid and later in barcelona , will realize exactly the importance of the european role in a country like spain .
for spain is a model of a state , in which the more advanced surrounding european environs have contributed towards pushing the wheel of its development , until it has undoubtedly become today a state of an advanced and rising economic , cultural , and scientific caliber .
indeed , the spanish economy - inside the european wagon - has moved from a workers - exporting economy to an economy that imports workers with legal residencies , who are today mostly from latin america and a percentage ( about a third ) of expatriates from the arab north african states .
the new iraqi officials , previously the opposition , are still acting through their contacts with their counterparts in other countries with the mentality of the opposition , who need every help and service from this country or that .
they have not believed yet , or more accurately they have not yet become used to acting like statesmen of a country that is ready to become healthier than it was before .
the occasion of this talk is the manner of behavior of iraqi officials , who visited lebanon , through damascus , during the recent weeks , the last of whom was a delegation from the interim council , the council that was until yesterday " illegitimate and does not represent the iraqi people " , according to statements by senior officials , who warmly received its delegation last week . praise the almighty , who changes ways .
what was noticeable in the statements of the head of the delegation , muwaffaq al rubei , after meeting with lebanese prime minister rafic hariri , was his saying that he asked him for facilities for the entry of iraqis to , and their residence in lebanon and for discussing the development of iraqi - lebanese relations . even more strange and naïve was asking him for help in " improving the image of the new iraq among the arab brothers " .
is it logical that such a request comes from an official in a state that has all this nobility and dignity ?
who gave muwaffaq al rubei the right to violate the dignity of iraqis with such a beggary that is so degrading to iraq and its people ?
if al rubei did not know the criteria that controlled relations between states , he should have at least sought the help of advisors .
we hesitated more than once as we embarked on frank confession . we have warned of the policy of making ministries a hotbed for favoritism and we have already pledged to act as a positive opposition .
an opposition that watches over the rule and the rulers and tries to set their flaws straight , which unfortunately are many .
an opposition similar to western oppositions , that must remain strong , exactly as tony blair , the british prime minister , wished his country 's opposition would be when he said he is sad because his opposition is weak .
we reassure the ministers and tell them : do not be sad , because your opposition , thanks to your grave mistakes , is strong and seems to become stronger day after day .
the phrase " enough is enough " is a phrase that iraqis utter today with mouths full as they watch with amazement that cannot be surpassed the deteriorating circumstances of the administrations , ministries and the interim council in the country , including the pervasive corruption , favoritism , bribes and deals .
these defects , which we thought our new iraq had said goodbye to forever , are returning in a deteriorating manner .
even the draw for the hajj , the most sacred of ordinances , was embellished and poor applicants were deprived of the privilege , which was given to stronger leaders .
the main motive that necessitated the resumption of the execution of verdicts imposing the death penalty is , as you mentioned , " covering the scandal of the civil war culture whose accumulations have revealed the records of perpetrators " , whose lives have been terminated in the method that we witnessed on the 17th of january , 2004 .
but this motive might not be the only one that urged officials to make the decision today to execute the death penalties against perpetrators , selected according to criteria related not only to the danger of the crimes committed , but also to their sectarian loyalty , in keeping with sectarian equations .
the execution of the death penalties could also have its significance based on the culture of deterrence , oppression and terrorization .
it aims to create an atmosphere of terror in the soul , not only of those contemplating committing a certain crime for various reasons , but also in the souls of those who are thinking , as the authority believes , of freedom , liberation , opposition or overthrowing the regime and the current ruling clique , or even the idea of rebellion in this delicate phase the region is going through , which scares many rulers .
that is why the message was veiled , but at the same time clear for lessons to be learned .
with regard to the saying that lebanon has not yet become " a state of law " so that it might abolish the death penalty : without any embarrassment , we share with you the opinion that lebanon has not become yet " a state of law " , or more accurately " a state of rights " in the actual and european sense of the word , " etat de droit " , like the western european states , canada , japan and other states , even if lebanese legislation is mostly considered as laws that aim at making lebanon " a state of law and institutions " .
the practical reality in which lebanon is struggling has a clear indication that it , as you say , is a " state of no law " or a " state of no rights " .
what is wrong with the lebanese political leadership ? we hear them uttering only big words and speaking only about the confrontation with israel , about resistance and about disseminating the culture of resistance , while lebanon 's internal crisis is the basis , the addressing of which is supposed to be the starting point .
how do you want to spread the " culture of resistance " in the arab world , while the lebanese are governed by a controlling minority that sees in their suffering only the aspects of subordination and frightening factionalism that the citizen is forced into at all levels of his life and vital interests ?
it is important to talk about resistance and about the weapon of resistance . indeed , it is of utmost importance . but what can the lebanese do as they follow the news of deals and scandals by the dozen and stop before the continued conspiracy of the ruling class .
whether it is allegiance or opposition , civil or not civil , economic or judicial - it is a continuous conspiracy that reduces a majority that belongs to no particular sect , that has no color and no identity , except , perhaps , that it is vulnerable and almost despised in the heart of the minority in control , which does not see anyone to hold it accountable , stop it and deter it .
we live under the shadow of the culture of political pretense and hypocrisy .
we live under the shadow of a new kind of stratification .
a struggling stratification , a resistance stratification , a nationalist stratification , a financial stratification , an armed stratification , an intelligence stratification , and a mafia stratification , all of which are feeding on the silence of the people and their acceptance of table crumbs .
people who have accepted to be governed according to the stratification criteria of a type that is sharper and more severe than the old stratifications , which we have long been told , have produced the war .
no , the wolf , ariel sharon has not come out of his skin .
he is maneuvering in response to the requirements of the current stage , but his teeth and claws continue to be in the pouncing state .
there is an instantaneous need now for maneuvering , required by the personal dossier colored with bribery news , and imposed , of course , by a visit to the white house , at a time when george bush 's stock seems to be falling .
therefore , there is absolutely no objection to sharon exploding a loud sound bomb whose reverberations reach several places :
first : the corruption dossier that is closing around him , which includes his two sons omri and gilead , means that talks about the withdrawal project from settlements in gaza and the northern parts of the bank will shift the spotlights from the bribery dossier to the settlement issue .
second : to the united states and george bush , where the talk about withdrawals seems to be an attempt at saying that he is implementing provisions stipulated in the " road map " , while the palestinians do not implement the provision for stopping the violence and the " terrorism " .
third : to the positions of his extremist allies in the authority , who have always tried to impose their conditions upon him , even if these conditions are not completely contradictory with his policies .
after years of negotiations , and within the framework of the united nations ' " oil for food " program , the " sonatrach " company has been able to participate in the marketing of part of the iraqi oil .
and so , in each of the phases of exporting iraqi oil , we were allocated shares that were equal to the shares allocated to the other petroleum companies , including the american companies , through the " sonatrach " branch in london .
all that took place with the knowledge and approval of the united nations , and not directly with the iraqis .
perhaps for that reason , we were invited to organize humanitarian activities for the iraqi people .
we also sent aid consisting of pharmaceuticals , medical equipment and food items .
we supervised the training of approximately 60 iraqi oil engineers in algeria . we also opened an office in baghdad and contributed to organizing business trips for company directors , which were at the rate of two trips a year , to follow up the oil for food program in the field .
there are many aspects of similarity between the iranian situation that followed the collapse of the shah 's regime in the year 1979 and the iraqi situation after america overthrew saddam hussein 's regime .
the greatest similarity is clear in the administrative chaos and the attempt by elements of the former regime ( the shahinshahi in iran and the baathist in iraq ) to change their skin and adopt the slogans of the new situation .
but in practice , they continue the policy of their old regime every time they find a loophole they can penetrate .
this state can be applied to some of iraq 's embassies that were finally reopened ; the iraqis in exile were optimistic , but many were shocked with the reality of these embassies .
in the era of the defunct regime , all the iraqis are suffering .
inside , the ghosts of war and death in the cellars of the intelligence departments chase everyone , even those who believe they are acceptable to the regime or involved in its policies .
abroad , the regime pursues hundreds of thousands who could escape the daily death mill with their intelligence elements and by closing in on iraqis in their exile , the least of which was denying them the renewal of their passports or accrediting their certificates because the price in return would be no less than pledging to work as informants for the embassy which is , in reality , an intelligence cell .
there are few times in which democracy accompanies wars or in which wars lead to establishing a democratic regime , i.e. handing governance over to the people , instead of keeping it in the hands of generals , officers , colonels and even privates .
there is a crucial conflict between the military culture and culture of democracy .
the first is based on individualism , by virtue of the military rank , orders , obedience , and putting order and discipline before anything else - even if it is wrong - in adherence to the golden rule that says : " first execute and then object " , even if it is with cutting heads !
as for the second , it is based on consultation and dialogue , and putting public interest before individual interests . it also respects the right to have differences and to object . it does not recognize any right not approved by laws , considering that the people are the source of authority . therefore , it gives them legitimacy and holds them accountable , directly or indirectly .
accountability in the democratic culture is the golden rule to guarantee " discipline " , i.e. the order , and the separation of authorities in a manner that will prevent the dominance of one authority over the other , or the rule of someone over an institution , so that each authority can stop the other authority , without fighting amongst themselves , or they conspire and support each other in what serves their interests at the expense of the public interest , which is the interest of the people with all its individuals . these authorities would then tumble and lose the legitimacy they have earned .
no two persons disagree , if they are the least versed in the economic concern , that lebanon will face difficult financial imperatives that threaten it with bankruptcy in a short period of time if no economic renaissance takes place , which is now almost like a miracle .
the optimists speak of june 2005 as an unescapable date , unless lebanon succeeds in renewing international trust - which is non - existent today - on the occasion of the presidential elections , after the paris commitments have been lost in the wars of presidents .
that trust , and this is also what everyone working in the economy knows , passes currently through the partnership with the european union .
no matter how great the friendship between french president jacques chirac and lebanon , and whatever his distinctive relationship with prime minister rafic al-hariri ( assuming that the latter remains in his position ) , there will be no paris without a european congruity .
this is what gives great significance to the position that emerged in brussels during the meetings of the council of cooperation and partnership with lebanon .
of course , the european position had no sooner arrived in lebanon than every tom , dick and harry rose against this blatant interference in lebanon 's internal affairs which , just as a reminder , are complete sovereignty , independence and immunity against outside interventions .
no matter , we have plenty of time to disapprove , but let us first hear the tenor of the intervention .
the number is not small of those who went to do their " religious " duties with all submissiveness before his majesty the devil - the camera - from among the false witnesses , the silent witnesses and the traditional perpetrators , immediately after each of the two sessions , witnessed by the nijmeh square , ended , which were known beforehand to be of no value at all , except for causing some additional humiliation for those who do not , will not and did not care .
this is based on the evidence that their information kitchen disseminated through a number of media - after the first session - the " idea " of no winners and no losers .
it is an incorrect idea in two aspects :
the first aspect is that there is clearly a political winner . they are those who control the cellular phone sector inside the lebanon authoritarian balance , which is run by the syrian authority , which is a balance that includes in the " economic " partnership several sectors , whose beneficiaries are varied , including lebanese and non - lebanese .
the second aspect is that there are morally disgraced persons in this dossier , who lost - morally - to the disgracers , but were not their equals at all in this regard .
struggle - wise , therefore , the political disgracers have won .
was the pentagon 's hawk , richard pearl , the " scapegoat " which his friend , interim governing council member ahmad chalabi offered to be ? would the bush administration want a scapegoat to close up the scandal of faulty intelligence information about iraq before the war ?
or did he choose to resign from the council on defense policy at the pentagon to pursue his profitable projects and businesses in iraq ?
the reason that pearl gave for his resignation , i.e. , that he does not want his controversial opinions to affect the election campaign of president george bush , seems the least important .
ideologists like pearl do not resign this simply from such an influential position .
he spent 17 years occupying it and was not shaken by linking his name , at least during the past year , with more than one scandal .
even his relinquishing of the chairmanship of the council and his remaining as member last year were not linked to these scandals .
to find out the reason , it is inevitable to look to the iraqi dimension , where pearl is surrounded by two cases : the first , profitable transactions related to the reconstruction of iraq , and the second , those related to the war . investigations into them have started and they involve the two companies of hollinger and boeing .
one of the conclusions also is that the americans have never witnessed a more difficult palestinian - israeli situation than the one now prevalent .
not only is there the most right - wing and extremist government in the history of israel , there is also extremist israeli public opinion that ensures the survival and continuity of this government and each feeds the other .
as for the palestinians , the americans consider them to be at their worst situation , as there is no power for the non - islamist civilians to go ahead with the negotiations with sharon or confront him .
in turn , this situation has led to the conclusion that there is little , and very little , that can be done to improve the situation on the ground .
in principle , the diplomats concerned with this information do not oppose american conclusions in this regard , especially the impossibility of achieving anything now , or the scary situation lived by the palestinians . however , they consider that this situation is the logical result of israel 's persistent attempts , at least since october 2000 , to undermine all the components for building a palestinian state .
nor were the americans remiss in pushing towards this direction , whether by keeping silent about sharon 's practices , who hid behind the war of the united states on terrorism , to destroy all that could constitute the palestinian entity or through striking the palestinian authority itself represented by yasser arafat and eliminating all the possibilities of cooperation with him , which facilitated israel in isolating him and putting all the palestinian authority under quarantine .
one of the anecdotes about president elias hrawi is that whenever he wanted to corner trouble - making ministers in the cabinet , whom he believed might disagree with him on a matter he wanted to present outside the agenda , he would start his speech presenting the matter by saying , " there is a proposal by minister abdullah al amin " , who was a member in one of the governments during the hrawi era and was , at the same time , the national secretary of the baath party in lebanon .
and after presenting this matter , whatever it was , hrawi used to insinuate to those ministers who consulted him by whispering that the " brothers are in the picture " and are not far from this " proposal " . of course , he meant the " syrian brothers " , a matter which guaranteed the passing of the proposal , which was , in practice , a proposal by hrawi himself , without any objections or obstacles .
president hrawi told this amusing story on more than one occasion and many remembered it during the last two days in the context of reading the latest statements by minister suleiman franjieh , which was big and through which he violently attacked prime minister rafic al-hariri , accusing him of shirking the " line " , which he - i.e. al-hariri - is one of its pillars , but insinuated that he is helpless in his commitment to the " arab nationalist line " that expresses commitment to the alliance with syria .
alot was said about franjieh 's statements , known for a relationship with the syrian leadership , which has been historically very singular in its depth and consistency between the assad family and franjieh family " father from grandfather " , which has not been reached by any of syria 's allies nor lebanese friends .
one of the ironies in this relationship is that suleiman franjieh is one of those who make the least exaggerated statements , which , to many , amount to flattery and hypocrisy to the point that they almost lose their meaning .
based on this relationship , many read a " syrian message " in the part related to hariri in franjieh 's statements .
such a legitimate conclusion , while seemingly realistic for a moment , is at the same time seemingly " inaccurate " .
therefore , as long as we have freedom , it is inevitable that we enjoy it whatever the obstacles .
it seems this thinking is no longer theoretical for certain categories of the population of this country ; rather , it has come into implementation since way back .
among the models : the freedom of no - accountability , which keeps rulers away from real accountability .
the official commits mistakes and sins of the kind that causes grave losses for the homeland and the citizens .
but , the freedom practiced by him puts him in a position of one capable of theorizing about virtuousness .
it isthe freedom of no - explanation that equates those who are right with those who are wrong , upon which the reverberating slogans are unleashed that are fit for the phase that stretches from the dawn of history into the far future .
from the recent parliamentary deliberations , the iraqi oil coupons , the cotonou airplane disaster , and the city bank serial , we have examples that are still alive .
due to the freedom of no - explanation , everyone will feel relaxed and reassured , for there is noone specifically accused , but there are accusations ; there is no wrongdoer of specific identity , character , position , family and origins , but there are , rather , mistakes by the dozen .
the syrian president , in most of his recent audiences , if not all of them , has been keen on stressing three positions that are reflections of what seem to be an interest in emphasizing that which syria is thinking about for the time being :
the first is reiterating his commendation of maronite patriarch mar nasrallah butros sfeir , his appreciation of his wisdom in dealing with the dangerous developments facing the region , and his interest , based on this position , in all that reassures and comforts christians .
the second is highlighting his support of president emil lahoud , exceeding his national and strategic choices to reaffirming his trust in the " intent of the state project " that the president of the republic carries , away from bigotry and personal interests .
which is what more than one visitor heard from the syrian president .
the third is al-assad 's dissatisfaction with the lack of appreciation on the part of some allies of damascus of the seriousness and precariousness of this phase , and their persistence in drowning the internal situation in a political competition with alternate success and their preoccupation with dossiers that cannot be tolerated in the present time , such as this self - indulgence in , or passion for internal conflicts , whether related to presidential merit or to management of the authority and its files , including most recently the cellular telephones file .
i asked a minister friend for his opinion on the most recent position of the bishop 's council on the presidential elections . he answered me stressing the importance of this old - new position that very explicitly dotted the letters , whether at the level of the specifications of the person of the president , or at the level of the mechanism of selecting one .
he said that the position has become very clear and it waylays many , many interpretations and leakages about the presidential merit , which bkirki supports within the framework of respecting the laws and safeguarding the constitution .
then i asked him about the true reasons that led to the failure of president emil lahoud in implementing his reform project and about those who hindered this project according to his allegations . he shook his head without giving me an answer . i asked him then about the names of those who hindered the implementation of this project . i also did not receive any answer .
so i told him : could it be comprehensible that you do not have any reply to what president lahoud had stated on the issue of reform and hindering it ?
he shook his head again , sufficing with the phrase : " it is interdicted ! "
then i asked myself : is there anyone who can be absolutely certain that president lahoud has a reform project ?
and who has seen it ?
the matter seemed very funny when egyptian foreign minister ahmad maher and arab league secretary general amr musa stood before reporters and tried hard to keep the " strongly guarded secret " under the seal of secrecy and to maintain the complete blackout that surrounded the " document of developing joint arab action " .
why all this concern for secrecy and ambiguity ?
is it because arab citizens and public opinion in the arab countries have no right to know about matters and ideas related to the future of arab action , heaven forbid , or is it because these matters are just the specialty of regimes and rulers and the people can only wear what the revealed leaderships design ?
the matter seemed funny , because citizens in the arab states had read what the ap news agency reported on the saudi - egyptian reform initiative under the heading : " pledge and declaration to the arab people " , which calls for greater participation by the arab peoples in running their political , economic , social and cultural affairs .
how can these people participate in such delicate and important matters , if the " document " that the arab foreign ministers agreed upon to develop joint arab action remains a strongly guarded secret , as we said , and is then sent down onto the heads of people after the convening of the arab summit in tunisia - if it actually convened ?
and why the skepticism about the possibility of convening it ?
the late prime minister , rashid karami , preferred once to resign before the house of deputies at the beginning of the session to cause the opposition , which was threatening to refrain from giving him a vote of confidence , to miss the opportunity of scoring such a victory against him .
as he was declaring his resignation , he said , directing his speech at emil al bustani , the then leader of the campaign of opposition to the government , " i will leave a burn in your heart by depriving you of the joy of toppling the government by withholding confidence . "
the supporting deputies were used to foiling the quorum of the sessions only when the opposition deputies were in a position capable of overthrowing the government by withholding confidence in it . indeed , it was the opposition deputies , being a minority , who should have resorted to foiling the quorum to deprive the government of a guaranteed majority confidence .
as for his opinion on the current conflict between the prime minister and the minister of communications on the cellular phones , he said : " had those in power resorted to constitutional institutions to resolve their differences , what happened would not have happened , not in this subject , but in every other subject . "
the difference in the viewpoint of prime minister al-hariri and his likes , and the viewpoint of minister qurdahi and his likes , must be settled within the cabinet . the ministerial majority should support either the opinion of this or the opinion of that , so that the government faces the house of deputies while it is unified in its opinion and its stance on the subject .
on the other hand , the government must defend its opinion in the house of deputies and explain its viewpoint and stance on all that is brought up . so , either the deputies are convinced and the matter is ended , or they remain unconvinced . the parliamentary majority may then resolve the existing conflict with a vote , either in favor of the opposition or in favor of the government and its supporters , and the file is closed and it does not remain open as to what has happened . then , the people do not know where the truth lies , whether with regard to the figures of revenues from cellular phones or with regard to the conditions for competitions to determine the lowest and highest bidders .
syria and the lebanese regime that emanated from the taef accord held most christian political , partisan and religious groups responsible for the wide christian boycott of the parliamentary elections that took place in 1992 , after almost two decades of renewing the term for the parliament of 1972 because of the civil and uncivil wars that erupted in the country in 1975 .
at that time , the boycott was considered a sort of outflanking of the taef accord , especially on the part of some parties that supported it at that time , without whose sponsorship and understanding it would not have seen light .
they also considered it as a sign that some of those mentioned wanted a truce that enabled them to take breathers and regroup ranks in preparation for a decisive or conclusive battle with the syrian military and political presence in lebanon when conditions for it became available .
at that time , syria punished the boycotters by driving them away from the first taef government , if it can be said this way . but , after reevaluating the internal lebanese situation and its interests in lebanon and , consequently , in the region , it gave the green light for the participation of some of those in the second government .
except that the method in which these few suggested to damascus , in spite of their acceptance of participation , even after lowering its level , that nothing had changed in their strategic position on syria and its regime in lebanon .
of course , that upset syria , but it did not consider it a " crisis " because christian representation in the taef governments and beyond , as well as all the other institutions of the state , was reasonable to a great extent .
there is , on one hand , the most prominent northern christian leader , suleiman franjieh .
and , on the other hand , there is the former " leader " of the " lebanese forces " , ellie hubaiqah .
the crisis - ridden official arab order is more like a wagon heading downhill into the abyss at great speed that accelerates with the passage of time . it has no breaks that assist it to stop or even slow down the push .
that is the official arab scene that looms over us in the cairo meetings : confusion beyond all confusion from the throng of external " initiatives " that are closer to colonial dictates wrapped in a modern discourse and armed with a package of " international reports " .
a strong feeling of impotence and weakness towards the collapse of official arab immunity ( except for its intelligence and police side , which remains critical ! ) prevails .
the defeat of saddam 's iraq and , subsequently , the occupation of the largest of the arab states , is a harsh message to the arabs of coups and to the militaria that the age of imaginary victories has ended or that full stomachs do not save people from desolation , despair and resorting to violence .
even with that , more and more the stomachs that were once full are becoming empty .
gone is the era of wealth and boom , or what is called the age of the oil innocence .
the agenda of president amin jmayyel for the presidential elections differs from some of what has been said in this regard in recent weeks , as he sees in it a serious opportunity for syria , not to affect change in lebanon alone , but also to reaffirm its desire to expand the range of this change so that it also is concerned with it as well .
this point of view prompts him to rule out any american role in the coming lebanese presidential elections for reasons , some of which he attributes to the fact that lebanon is no longer a direct american interest , and others to the fact that the american interest is focused now on a new middle east , dominated by reform and democracy , in which lebanon is only a small detail , and some third to the american - syrian relations , which dictate that lebanon is an item in them .
in spite of that , the former president holds on to opposing an extension for president emil lahoud and does not hesitate in correcting an old rule of the falange party , which he believes has been deliberately distorted recently , which is that the support by the falange party of the president of the republic , any president of the republic , has never led to supporting the renewal of his term or its extension .
this was the situation of the party with president bishara al-khoury , when it was a partner in overthrowing him in the year 1952 and then with president fouad shihab , when it opposed his remaining in power for anther term in the year 1964 .
thus , he sees in article 49 one of the sources of strength for the lebanese regime , as it allows , first of all , the alternation of authority in a manner not familiar to the arab regimes neighboring lebanon , which are drowning in their dictatorships . secondly , it paves the way for accountability and calling on the president to be accountable , who does not realize that his term is coming to an end , and so he does not persist in the perpetration .
after a national , official and popular funeral ceremony for the martyred prime minister , rashid karami , in tripoli , a meeting was held in the karami family palace with the participation of the majority of those who attended the dar al fatwa meeting with syrian vice - president abdul halim khaddam , who seemed angry over the resolution that was issued by the said meeting , speaking about rashness " with the blood of the martyr not dry yet " .
then he turned to al hoss saying : " when you come to visit us in damascus , remind me to let you listen to a recording that reveals to you how the preparations for attempting to assassinate you were carried out so that you know who the criminals are " .
after days , al hoss visited damascus accompanied by al husseini . they met with khaddam , who replied to al hoss 's question about the promised recording by saying , " do you want to hear the case from the mouth of elie hubaiqah ? "
al hoss replied : " let me hear from you . "
khaddam told the story of a meeting that included hubaiqah and two heads of security departments in the era of al jmayyel , who were among the pillars of his reign , at the home of the president of a parliamentary bloc and a current deputy , who visited al hoss especially in 1990 to reaffirm to him that he had nothing to do with the explosion that targeted him .
al hoss told the story , supported by minutes and names in his book " for truth and history " on pages 53,54 , and 55 .
is it true that the united states of america is not concerned with the presidential elections in lebanon , nor with who will be selected president of the republic , contrary to the position it had held before ?
in fact , opinions vary in this regard .
a former secretary of state says that the united states of america is no longer concerned with the presidential elections as in the past , because the lebanese state , after the taef accord , gradually started to lose its role and freedom of decision . this role has become perplexing for syria in all sorts of areas , not only in political , defense , security and foreign areas and matters , but also in internal political affairs , with their smallest details , and in daily political life .
the lebanese state cannot , for example , enter into peace negotiations with israel unless the syrian state approves this beforehand , nor can it sign a peace treaty unless syria signs this agreement . it cannot deploy the lebanese army on the borders with israel unless an agreement has been achieved on this with syria , nor can it terminate the role of the lebanese resistance , specifically " hizbollah " , even if israel withdraws from all the lebanese territories it occupies , unless syria approves that .
because the lebanese and syrian tracks are inseparable , everything related to the matter has been subjected to coordination and understanding between the two countries .
this inseparability means the inseparability of both the track and the destiny , so that the president of the lebanese republic has now become syrian - made , and not made by lebanon , and the formation of governments in lebanon takes place with syrian intervention to overcome obstacles that stand in the way of their formation .
if that is the situation of the lebanese state under the situation prevailing for over twenty years , which is an odd situation , why should there be an interest in the opinion of this state as long as it has no opinion , but the opinion is rather vested in the syrian state and any talk about all matters should be with it ?
talk about the situation of the arab woman ; international women 's day is different this year , not because there has been a change in recognizing their rights and protection , but because these rights are now at the forefront of discussions about reforms in the region that are not advocated only by the west ; many arab regimes are keeping pace with it , even if the matter seems , on many occasions , as a sudden discovery of half of the society .
but , whether there is discussion about the state of women and their rights as a result of outside pressures or others , then no matter , because there are features of change that have started , and do not mean in any case that the course is not long and not thorny .
the voices of arab women are rising . a salutation on this occasion goes to all the male and female conferees , who are meeting around the cause of women at the beirut summit and several other conferences in the arab world . another salutation goes to the sultanate of oman , which has chosen the occasion to appoint a woman , for the first time , in an important ministerial position , which is the ministry of higher education .
this is a movement and a set of features that do not cancel the fact that the most important means for eliminating discrimination against women is to enact laws that guarantee their rights in several fields , from the home and family to society and work , in both the private and public fields .
here the problem of women 's representation in political life in the arab world is presented , which is a shameful representation , where the few exceptions do not constitute an intercession on its behalf , neither in the single - party systems , nor in those that boast of a little democracy like lebanon .
in this regard , the special provision on women 's representation in the interim iraqi constitution signed yesterday , deserves thinking about its worth .
