< headline > why do we muslims insist on application of human rights to islamic minorities in west , when we refuse same for christians in countries where we are majority ?
written by dr. yousri moustafa , an anti - terrorist islamic author .
if our islamic governments , who adopt islam as a source of legislation , do not support human rights , specifically the performance of religious rituals for the minorities , it is an understandable thing . but the consideration of human rights as suspicious by a few elitist and popular groups , far from the governmental space , needs to be considered and explained .
we have noticed , in the expanse of years gone by , that one the greatest challenges confronting human and women 's rights groups is the inclusion of human rights in a culture that still refuses to recognize the principles of human rights and their internationality .
as we know , the main grounds for the refusal of human rights are represented by cultural specificity ; the proclamation arguing that ' our societies are different in their values to those of human rights ' , qualifying them as being of a foreign source and nature .
in any case , the difficulty in promoting a culture of human rights is not only due to the state 's restraints , but also some general cultural restrictions , fed by cultural specificities that aim to deprive human rights of their international legality .
in reality , this cultural rejection is a factor not to be ignored , and which contributes , in non - governmental spheres , to strong political and ideological turmoil . better than ignoring it would be to research its causes .
i believe that if human rights principles are not striking a chord in our societies , it is not due to their strangeness , but our unfamiliarity with their legal and political makeup , and the handling of human rights with double standards .
it is clear to anyone familiar with them that human rights are not to be refused in their totality , but only in some areas . collective rights , for instance , are acceptable , as well as political rights . even if it worries the government , they will find attentive ears in the opposition , including those who promote a discourse of cultural exclusion .
individual rights , these are the real hurdle . they provoke the supporters of cultural specificity and exclusion , not only within governments , but also in political and ideological forces allied with the authorities , creating antagonistic public opinion towards the internationality of human rights , all in the name of specificity .
when we talk about the right to our own development , we sense universal satisfaction and accuse the westerners of using us . but when we talk about the right to form political parties , the opposition responds , and the government gets angry .
but when the issue concerns the freedom of thought and belief , or women 's individual rights , the proponents of cultural exclusivity deprive human rights of any legality , considering them to be western ideas . thus the desire for cultural independence is not against human rights in general , but only partially and selectively , especially when those rights are concerned with individual freedom .
therefore , if we wish to search for the reason that human rights principles lack cultural validity in our societies , we must start by examining our cultural and political positions on individual rights .
it is our task to seize the thread at its beginning , beginning with the question of the extent of the individual rights ' legality themselves , before discussing the legality of human rights .
the edifying article by the german philosopher habermas , entitled " the increase of legality through human rights " states that modern laws originate essentially in individual rights .
these individual rights allow the individual to behave , within the law , according to his private priorities .
hence these rights cause a person to dispense , and in a better and amended way , with moral instruction or tutelage of any kind .
in any case , no - one is legally obliged , within the allowed legal boundaries , to to publicly account for his actions .
habermas points to the inclusion of individual rights in modern legal constitutions . as a result , it has become different from the traditional legal system that confirms hobbes ' theory saying that everything is allowed which is not explicitly forbidden ; thus law and ethics are separated .
the separation of law and ethics in modern legislation is an important matter . not because we love law and hate ethics , but because this is the modern historical logic of the principle of the rule of law .
this separation has historically allowed the grouping together of people with legal backgrounds in line with the concept of individual rights , versus traditional frameworks , wherein ethical people are grouped and governed by the edicts of traditional morality , based on religion , customs and traditions , or even modern political ideologies .
and if modern law is based on the principle of individual rights , the moralistic dialogue depends on a pluralistic interpretation of rights and duties .
in reality , when a matter concerns the individual , in our society , we find ourselves living a tridimensional existence : first , we have legality , imposed by historical development which we cannot deny , and laws governing us , even if they detract from our common and individual rights .
secondly , in parts of the civil code , religious people , moral people and terrorists mingle . for example , laws of civil status or , freedom of thought and belief , or the practice of religious rites of minorities .
thirdly , we are people , obedient for the greater part of our lives , to finite moral rules . they have more power than laws , especially when the matter concerns individual rights .
to a certain extent , freedoms not limited by law are limited by morality , to the detriment of the law .
the example for that is the religious mass orations . where the decision maker interferes to impose upon the individual a way of life in the context of established rules and moral vetoes , which are illegal and through which the lives of individuals are organized , being qualified as moral beings .
some people imagine that legal rules are in a continuous struggle with moral ones . this is not true for the most part .
law and ethics meet in a positive fashion when law and ethics criminalize together , in the case of murder , and theft , for example .
but they also meet in a negative way , to curtail freedom and individual rights .
in our societies , law lags behind , only in its repressive forms , and leaves center - stage to moral rules . this is not because it competes with them , but because these rules play an active role beneficial to the authorities ; that is , the difficult task of social control , specifically in the context of individual rights and freedoms .
according to this disciplined scheme , an alliance takes place between the three authorities : political , religious , and traditional authorities .
whatever cannot be legally controlled , becomes morally controllable , and some sort of punishment will befall the individual even if he does not break the law .
it is remarkable that this method of control relies on moral punishments which might develop into plain brutality . individuals are classified , not on the basis of their abidance by or defiance of law , but on the basis of a moral particularity , relating to the " pure and impure " in their primary meaning .
the religious address to women relies on a sort of moral division . it says that the veil means virtue and purity , and consequently , that those who do not wear it will be socially and culturally punished , and considered as having lost their validity in relation to virtue and purity .
we also find this kind of division within political ideologies . we hear talk about honorable citizens , referring to those who do not follow this political line as just citizens . if they oppose , they expose themselves to the risk of being judged dishonorable citizens .
the language of virtue , purity and honor includes a sort of illegal punishment for the puritans .
here appears the crisis of the legality of human rights . the language of human rights is basically a human and legal language , designed for the address of legal beings living under a political and legal system , and based upon citizenship that recognizes individual rights and protects them .
but the problem , as already shown , resides in the fact that the legal body itself does not acquire a cultural legality , and is substituted with basically moral entities .
and accordingly , the discourse of human rights enters a sphere alien to its language and legal vocabulary , and cooperation with it is carried out in a selective fashion , wherein the collective is accepted while the individual is refused .
the true legality of human rights can be established only when there is universal recognition of their legality .
this recognition will not happen as long as there are authorities who fear human rights , and individuals who ignore the language of the law , which is the language of human rights , and adopt the language of morality , which is the language of political and religious power , and the authority of custom and tradition .
this highlights the importance of defending citizenship , not by qualifying it as simply tolerance and common life , but by conceptualizing it as a project of civil rights , and once again considering the legal institution as based upon individual rights and freedoms .

cows make mistakes !
badriya al-abd al-rahman 2/1/1427 01/02/2006
i know that my topic is the islamic arena 's hottest topic at the moment ...
it might be repetitive for many of you to speak about the danish foolishness which ignited the feelings of muslims all around the world .. how can we decipher and dampen an escalating situation that threatens terrible outcomes ...
what is the story ?
how can we appropriately analyze this unique act ?
can it be read , for example , as a blunt awakening of religious fanaticism in an era of tolerance and moderation ?
or is it more the blunt awakening of anti - religious fanaticism against religion and religious symbols ?
even stranger is this happening in a peaceful and calm country , clearly isolated from the international arena ... maybe it 's political stagnation , ( ! ) and geographical remoteness from countries with intellectual and societal clashes with muslims in particular , or just other societies in general ; it is a matter that inspires debate ,
for a particular magazine to make an attempt ( even if exceptional ) to provoke the anger of the followers of islam , which millions practice worldwide ...
what 's worse is for all this provocation to take place not for the sake of any good , or to move the stagnant discussions with the " other " , but to create islamic stereotypes , to which we can attach accusations and specific preconceived notions of our religion .
it was all a scene of ( danish ) stupidity , and of great oppressiveness , which i do not think will pass through history easily ... and i do n't think that the country of cows and butter , with it 's highly pleasant image , needed to boast - when it wanted to boast - by provoking islam and muslims of different sects ...
why islam alone ... ?
the greatest symbol of this religion is its noble prophet , peace and blessings upon him . an impudent picture of stereotype has been marketed about islam , describing it the religion of bombs and death in a very clear way , in a clearer than clear way . the duty of cartoons in newspapers is to confirm an agreed upon , real and current idea , and none can dispute this except the foolish .
like this we are simply cancelled , and the long history of a major religion is cancelled by a cartoon insulting only to us , from all other religions and intellectual groups in the world . in the name of many of them , outrage and crimes have been committed against the whole world , but islam is the only one remaining on the death list .
this is how sanctity is insulted and fanaticism rises up to above red line , exceed it by hundreds of meters without shame or intellectual judgement . it is as if religions have become unsalable products and goods which bear no resemblance to what they stand for , perform and effect in the hearts of their followers ...
in a nutshell , it is impudence and impertinence in terms of thought , politics , and every known convention . nothing can describe this foolishness , except to say it is impudence , after which denmark should not await any foolish act to be taken against it due to this impudence , because in short it was more disobedient and unjust .
rue this picture , not only because it is false and ugly , but also because it awakens many issues that have been turning the western mind against the muslim for many centuries . the islamist represents death , the sword , horses and beheading in the way of allah , and no more .
now they have been aroused , and the partial harmony which muslims in the west enjoy , especially in denmark , destroyed , all because of a few radicals ( of any intellectual party ) who do not realize the danger of what they have done .
for god 's sake , what has denmark done to itself ?
and how does it expect to gain our respect after all that has happened ?
how can it now protect its citizens who live in islamic countries , or anywhere else , considering the bitter anger which muslims now feel ?
just some questions , which i do n't know if they passed through the minds of denmark 's general public and legislators . are their minds still too occupied milking their cows and spreading their butter , unaware of the magnitude of the problem that has been caused by the editorial staff of a magazine , and which has now become the template for every danish person in the mind of every muslim .
we boycott in order to be
the united messages via sms and e - mail to boycott danish products and defame them , is a healthy and good step which i support without any restrictions ...
ever since we boycotted american and israeli products , the arab mind has been jumping and creating his many , strong and at sometimes very hard " no " s. . but in a pleasant method which arouses interest even if we differ with them .
the international mind must understand that the muslim is no longer one of a group of countries , whose majority belongs to third world , whose issued are decreed ( when taym is absent , no one leading them and they are witnesses ) .. but he has become an educated person , aware of his cultural background which is the islamic religion , regardless of its different sects and varying duties towards religious rulings ...
most importantly he now knows how to say no in a civilized loud voice and in a way that describes his restlessness from western arrogance which encircles westerners against arabs , whom they need , resort to and line up in queues to obtain visas to work there .
western arrogance which has lengthened , continued and finally overwhelmed to the extent of insulting sanctities . sanctities that are big red lines in all cultures and the right of every person to oppose insulting them with sarcasm and belittling .
when i say this , i know that my , you and our boycotting wo n't affect or lessen the importance of danish butter , it 's widespread reputation or stupid cows . but we will do it for ourselves , so we do n't lose the only simple " no " which we own now and speak
let us say : we are present and existent on this planet despite all our problems and crisis . we are able to live peacefully together , deserve respect , have the right to express and reject and even hate if the matter requires so .
so that new disturbance and hatred is n't aroused in the ocean of hatred which this planet swells in , i wish denmark takes the initiative to a widespread and deep apology to the feelings of muslims and calms down the size of this crisis .
and not to wait for what is in muslims ' hearts to be wiped away in one go and by one apology , because the shock 's size was great and removing it wo n't be easy
because if this apology does n't happen , we will spend all our life playing on this musical tune , experiencing the pain of hatred and upbringing our children that denmark and satan are brothers , whatever applies to one is applicable to the other .
if the apology does n't take place , the embers of hatred will remain lit . denmark might even be surprised by a matter because it provoked muslims ' feelings . it might find a good practical example of the sampled tough terrorist with the turban ( of a bomb ) in its land , between its beautiful towers and heavy cows .
denmark might lose it 's beauty and simplicity because of ( the length of its tongue )
its cows might have blabbered in a ( more stupid ) fashion this time ...
we might not need more than the next couple of days to witness something in denmark which we did n't wish before
everything might happen ( here or there )
how much i hate ( might ) in these contexts , oh allah save us from their evil .

negative and positive self - programming
most people are programmed , from an early age , to act , speak and believe in a certain negative way . it grows with them until they become captives of what is called " negative programming " , which limits them from gaining many things in life .
we find that many say : " i am weak in character " , " i ca n't quit smoking " , " i am a bad speaker " , i am. ..
we usually find they have acquired this negativity from their family , school , or friends , or all of the above .
is it possible to change this negativity with positive programming ? the answer is yes , a thousand times yes . but why do we need to ?
we need to program ourselves positively in order to be successful and happy , and to live a pleasant life , in which we fulfill our dreams and goals . especially considering that we are muslims , and we have a duty and goal which we must reach so that we may attain the favor of allah , the exalted , and achieve the caliphate which allah gave us in the land .
before we start the course in changing negative programming , we must agree on some things :
you must decide within yourself that you want to change . this decision of yours is what will illuminate the path to change from negativity to positivity .
repeat the sayings and actions which will be introduced to you and make them a part of your life .
now , the first way to positive programming is :
speaking to yourself :
have you ever seen a person talking to himself in a loud voice while walking , moving his hands , mumbling , and maybe even swearing and cursing ? sorry , but we do not want to do this .
or has it happened that a big argument took place between you and someone else , and afterwards the argument is replayed like a tape in your mind ? you start to imagine the argument once again , replacing words and expressions with others , all the while asking yourself " why did n't i say such and such ? " ...
has it happened that while you were listening to a lecture or sermon , you said to yourself " i could not lecture like this person " , or " how could i stand in front of so many people " , or " it is impossible for me to stand in front of people and lecture or give a sermon " ?
all these conversations and talks with the self and soul bring a person to negative programming , which might , in the end , result in evil acts .
luckily , you and i and any person , are able to react to speaking with the self , and we are able to change negative programming so that new programming , which will give us power , can be established .
a psychoanalyst has said : " at any moment , we are able to change our past and future by reprogramming our present " .
so from now on , pay attention to the inner voice which speaks to you .
it has been said :
mind your thoughts because they can become actions .
mind your actions because they can become habits .
mind your habits because they will become your nature .
mind your nature because it will determine your destiny .
i would like to clarify some scientific facts about the human mind , and concentrate on the unconscious mind .
the unconscious mind does not understand things as does the conscious mind , it simply stores information and repeats it later , when it is drawn from its storage place .
if it happened that a message was programmed many times in this mind , and for a long time , such as saying in every situation , " i am shy " , " i am nervous " , or " i ca n't play sport " , " i ca n't quit smoking " and the like , these messages would become deep - rooted , and would settle at a deep level in the unconscious mind , making them difficult to change . but they can be replaced with healthier positive programming .
another fact is that the unconscious mind has strange traits that we must be attentive to . for example , if i said to you " do n't think about a black horse " , can you do that and prevent your mind from thinking ? of course not , you will immediately think of a black horse .
why ?
your mind cancelled the words " do not " and kept the remainder of the expression , " think about a black horse " .
so is it possible to utilize these strange traits of the mind ?
let us present it to you in a nutshell , and allow doctor ibrahim al-faqi to tell us the rules and practical methods of positive self - programming , as he talks about in his book ' the power of controlling the self ' .
he says :
i present the five rules of programming your unconscious mind :
1- your message should be clear and precise .
2- your message should be positive ( for example , " i am powerful " , " i am healthy " , " i can quit ... " ) .
3- your message should be in the present ( for example , do n't say " i will become more powerful " , but rather , " i am powerful " ) .
4- your message should be accompanied by a strong will concerning its contents , so that your unconscious mind can accept and program it .
5- you must repeat the message a couple of times until it is totally programmed .
now here is the plan , so that your message to yourself will have a positive effect :
write down at least five negative messages that have had an effect on you , for example :
i am a shy person , i ca n't quit smoking , my memory is weak , i ca n't speak in front of crowds and i am nervous , etc. now tear up the paper on which you wrote these negative messages and throw it far away .
write down five positive messages that will give you power , always starting with i , for example :
" i can quit smoking " ... " i love talking to people " ... " my memory is strong " ...
" i am an excellent person " ... " i am active and have a lot of energy " ...
write down the positive messages in a small diary and keep it with you at all times .
now , take a deep breath and read the messages one by one until you understand them .
once again , start with the first message , take a deep breath , let out any nervousness , read the first letter ten times with strong feeling , close your eyes and imagine your new self , then open your eyes ...
starting from today , mind what you say to yourself and to others , and mind what others say to you . if you notice a negative message , cancel it by saying " cancel " , and replace it with another positive message .
rest assured that you have power , that you are able to be , and able to do , what you like by determining exactly what you want and moving in this direction with all your power . jim rohn , author of " everlasting happiness " , said about this that " repetition is the basis of all skills " .
that is why you should be confident in what you say , always repeating to yourself the positive messages . you are the master of your mind and captain of your ship . you control your life and are able to change your life into an experience of infinite happiness , health and success .
and always remember :
live every moment as if it 's the last moment of your life .
live in faith , live in hope .
live in love , live in struggle .
and give value to life .
adapted from doctor ibrahim al-faqi 's book , ' the power of controlling the mind '
finally i ask for guidance , forgiveness and mercy .
amen
your brother in allah .

causes and treatment of dandruff .
i think it is a very common problem that everyone suffers from at some point in their life .
back in the day , it was believed that dandruff was caused by the rapid growth of the scalp 's cells , but this belief has been proved wrong .
it was discovered recently that the cause of dandruff is a type of yeast called pityrosporum ovale .
the problem arises because of poor blood circulation in the scalp .
concern
use hot water to wash hair
the oily nature of hair plays a major role
sometimes dandruff does not cause any problems worth mentioning , but when it falls on clothing , causes an itch , or gives hair an undesirable odor , problems start to arise .
an elegant look and prestige goes with the wind , and dandruff becomes a question in need of an answer .
the question is , how do we treat it ?
there are general pieces of advice of which we must first be aware , and they are :
1. do not use other people 's tools to do your hair .
2. look after your personal tools ; in other words , wash your brush and comb at least once a week .
3. wash your hair with certain types of treatment shampoo , available at various outlets .
i recommend the use of nizoral shampoo , not for the sake of advertising , but because this shampoo contains ketoconazole , which is effective in destroying the yeasts that cause dandruff .
4. after using the shampoo , rinse your hair with vinegar diluted with water , while massaging your scalp .
in addition to this , there are some very effective prescriptions .
wash your hair .
wash your hair with apple vinegar .
leave it for 15 minutes .
rinse it .
wash your hair .
mix half a cup of apple vinegar with half a cup of lemon juice .
massage your scalp with this mixture .
keep the mixture on your head for half an hour .
rub your hair with olive oil and leave it there for another 15 minutes , then wash your hair with shampoo .
repeat the procedure once a week to get rid of dandruff ; you might not need more than once a week .
olive oil , almond oil and cactus oil help restore scalp 's balance and provide nutrition .
greetings , and may you remain in good health .

sufferings in the red sea .
my father put on me the safety ring buoy when he saw the ship tilting and about to sink .
after that i saw my father drown , then my mother ,
i remained alone for 30 hours , fighting the waves with the help of another survivor , until the rescue squad arrived and pulled me out of the water .
everything was lost ,
i was an expatriate in saudi arabia for three years in which i suffered bitter hardship .
i returned with my life savings , to get married and settle down .
but suddenly everything was lost ... everything .
a fire ignited in the basement of the ship .
the crew prevented some passengers who saw the fire from wearing life vests , under the pretense that it would cause a state of panic for other passengers for which there is no need .
then the result was as you saw .
the ship sank and with it drowned more than a thousand passengers .
when we saw smoke coming out of the engine room in the basement , the ship 's crew told us not to worry , as they would put it out .
when things got much worse , we did n't find the rescue boats because some workers on the ship had taken them and left us on the ship to encounter death on our own .
i was in water for 30 hours , fighting death ...
30 hours without food or drink .
may skin was close to dissolving .
where is respect to our humanity ?
if the ship 's passengers were israeli , would they have handled the issue with the same degree of negligence or tardiness ?
allah blessed me with 3 kids , 2 daughters and 1 son , and we used to live in saudi arabia together .
then we decided to finally come back and settle down in egypt .
i shipped my house furniture , my children 's books and all our stuff .
after a while of sailing , fear overwhelmed us when seeing smoke ascending from the ship ,
then it tilted to one side and sunk .
i saw my 3 children and wife screaming and swallowing water while i was screaming and trying to save them , but allah 's fate was supreme .
they all drowned in front of my eyes .
their books and some of their toys floated to the surface .
the lord alone compensates us ...
there is no might or power , but allah 's
when the fire expanded , we heard explosions in the kitchen of the ship .
we thought it was the result of gas cylinders blowing up .
we yelled for the captain to return to the dhaba port because it 's closer than the safaga port , but he refused .
after we were overwhelmed by fear , the captain ordered us to knock on doors to get passengers out of their cabins and gather them on the right side so the ship could regain its balance . but within 5 minutes everyone was drowning .
screaming and wailing escalated .
the men were calling for allah 's help , " oh lord save us ... oh lord be merciful upon us . "
"
others were reciting the two testimonies .
*****
may allah be merciful on the victims of the accident and grant their parents patience and consolation .

because it is one of the sacred months , and a month of great importance to god , glory and reverence to him , it was received by the prophet - peace and blessings of allah be upon him - who qualified it as the month of god .
it is the month of muharram .
volunteering to fast in it , is the best way to get close to god .
and it is better than any voluntary fasting done during the year .
increase fasting during this month .
do n't forget us in your prayers ,
allah 's peace and blessings be upon our prophet mohammed and all his family and companions .

< headline > chastity of men
< poster > abu sulaiman
why does n't the chastity of men have value or respect any more ?
why does a chaste man , who elevates himself above his lusts , become astonishing and suspicious ?
why is the man who has n't engaged in illicit sex before marriage considered stupid in the opinion of some ?
why is the man who does n't betray his wife considered a coward , who fears his wife discovering his affair , or whose masculinity is doubted ?
our societies lend great importance to the virginity of women .
but why does n't anyone speak about the virginity of men ?
in the era of liberalization and development , there 's been a spread of means facilitating sin .
temptations have surrounded us from every angle , making them ever easier
to reach , for there is nothing easier than wrong conduct which drags people to vice .
but this is not an excuse to justify sin .
even though both women and men are exposed to the same temptations , they are equal in reward and punishment .
according to the divine rule where he said : ( say to the believing men that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty , and say to the believing women that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty ) .
since it is most correct and just for our conduct to be measured according to divine rule and law , we find in the qur'an a clear indication , generalizing this concept to both males and females ...
allah said : " for men and women who guard their chastity , and for men and women who engage much in allah 's praise , - for them has allah prepared forgiveness and great reward . " [ al-ahzab : 35 ]
so men 's chastity is no less important than that of women and it does n't lessen their masculinity , so as chastity is required of women , it is also required of men .
we must broaden the concept of virginity to include both man and woman , so a balance can be achieved .
but in our eastern societies where concepts have become unbalanced ,
chastity is only required of the woman , which is all she possessed and the basis of her family 's dignity .
as for man 's chastity , speak freely with no embarrassment .
there 's nothing wrong with him , starting from the notion that any sin is allowed if it does n't expose him in the eyes of people .
this is an invitation for everyone to seek chastity , refrain from committing sin ,
and get rid of the widespread concept that man 's chastity is an obscurity of which he feels ashamed and from which he steers clear , so he is not accused of stupidity , lack of education and little experience .
man 's chastity means his conservatism , and it is a great characteristic by which he preserves his faith and becomes righteous , refrains from sin and allah 's wrath and guards his health from disease .
chastity begins in the heart then expands to the body . in man , it is a clear sign of his strong character , being far superior to , and refraining from , indecent acts , suppressing lascivious desires and controlling himself from following his whims .
a chaste man is a rational one , who is able to control all his desires and instincts , and who does n't allow himself to satisfy them , except in that of which allah approves .
he is a patient righteous person who is far superior to falling into vice and excels high above his lust .
he possesses rare morality , which no one can sustain , except those of strong faith .
in the qur'an , there is a call to every bachelor .
{ and let those who cannot find a match keep chaste }
thaalab explained it by saying :
discipline yourself with fasting , for it is protection .
chastity is required from both the married and unmarried .
many are the men who betray their wives and boast in their gatherings about their adventures so that they do n't appear in front of others as lower in status , lesser in masculinity or an object of mockery .
dear brother , i ask you not to become weak and to preserve your purity and chastity ,
and not to weaken in the face of temptations .
try to increase your faith in allah .
if you become weak , remember that allah sees you , you will be questioned and so will we , about our actions and your masculinity wo n't intervene to make allah forgive you , the divine words are clear .
chastity is n't a requirement for women alone , but obligatory upon every person .
do n't make the society judge your deeds .
if you are saved from the judgement of this world , you ca n't escape punishment in the hereafter .
remember that death does n't seek permission before taking one 's life .
whenever it comes , it wo n't give you a chance to repent .
and when its term cometh , they cannot put it off an hour nor yet advance it .
ف ا ن ر ض ي ت ب ا خ ب ث ا ل ا ع م ا ل ف ل ا ت ن ت ظ ر و ل ا ت ط ل ب ا ل ط ي ب م ن ا ل ر ز ق
and remember that reward is from the same class as deeds
if you are inflicted , do n't awaite allah to send you with a righteous wife
allah says in al-nur chapter ( vile women are for vile men , and vile men for vile women . good women are for good men , and good men for good women ; such are innocent of that which people say : for them is pardon and a bountiful provision . )
"
oh allah , i ask you modesty and satisfaction
"
we ask allah to keep away all harm and evil from muslim youth
allah is better at guarding , and he is the most merciful of those who show mercy .
< headline > oh , my lord !
< poster > abu sulaiman
they bound her firmly ...
and deprived her of her senses ...
she felt that she was placed on what seems like a howdah ... in its height and motion ...
she heard the voice of her beloved amongst them ...
why is n't he rebuking them ... ?
why is he not preventing them from taking her ... ?
the sound of monotonous steps treading on rough soil ...
cool morning breezes caress her white clothes ...
even though she ca n't see , she imagined the climate around her to be foggy ...
and imagined the ground she 's on now , to be a deserted empty lot .
..
at last the steps stopped all of a sudden and she felt she was placed on the ground .
beside her , she heard rocks lifted and others put down .
she was lifted again ... silence enveloped her ... she felt the darkness gnawing at her bones ...
from above she heard a crying voice ... it 's her son ... yes , it 's him .
maybe he 's coming to save her ?
but what does she hear ?
he calling out to her in a low voice : mother ...
amid his tears , her husband tells him : be patient
patience comes only with the first shock ...
supplicate for her my son ...
let 's go ...
agony overwhelmed him ..
he took a last glance at the deceased body ... he could n't control himself , but said in a voice full of pain : there is no god but allah ...
there is no god but allah ...
we belong to allah and to him we shall return ...
that was the last of what she heard from him ...
a marble rock echoed , falling from above to block the only opening that was the source of sound , light and life ...
the sound of footsteps faded away ...
where to ?
where are you leaving me ?
how can you leave me in this loneliness and darkness ?
she looks around and sees .......
sees ? !!!
what can she see in this black cellar ?
its darkness is n't like that of night to which she was accustomed ... the latter is accompanied with moonlight and rays of stars reflecting on objects and people ... however here she can barely see her hand , in fact she feels her eyes are completely closed ...
she remembered her beloved ones ...
she heard the footsteps fade away entirely and a tremor flowed in her limbs ...
she rose to catch up with them ...
how can they leave her when they know she is afraid of the dark and of loneliness ?
but a heavy hand pushed her down forcefully ...
she gazed behind her with great fear ... she saw that which she had n't seen before .
she saw terror manifested in the image of a creature .
but how can she see him despite the pitch black ?
in a trembling voice she asked : who are you ?
she heard a voice on her right echoing loudly : we came to question you .
she turned around ...
it was another creature similar to the first ...
she helplessly fell silent ...
she wished the earth had swallowed her and that she 'd never seen these creatures .
but she remembered that the earth really had swallowed her ...
she wished to die , to escape this reality from which there is no escape ...
she was perplexed at her own aspirations which were of no more use ... for she is dead to begin with ...
who is your lord ?
huh ? - who is your lord ?
my lord ?
i worshipped none but allah all my life .
what is your religion ?
islam is my religion .
who is your prophet ?
my prophet ....... ?
she squeezed her memory ...
why did she forget his name ?
did n't she always utter it with her tongue ?
was n't she accustomed to evoking blessings on him five times a day during testimony ?
in an angry tone , the voice repeated the question : who is your prophet ?
one moment please ...
i ca n't remember ...
a great rod in the hand of the being rose ... descending quickly towards her head ...
she screamed ........
her organs grew stiff ...
suddenly his name illumined her mind .
she screamed at the top of her voice : my prophet is mohammed .
mohammed
she closed her eyes hard , but ........ nothing happened .
deadly silence ...
she opened her eyes in wonder .
the being whose name is nakir said to her : a supplication you always used to recite saved you ( oh , turner of hearts , make my heart firm , on your path ) .
her body trembled ...
she wanted to smile in delight , but could n't ...
this is not a matter for smiling ...
oh lord , when will these harsh moments end ....... ?
after a while munkar said to her : " you used to be tardy in the dawn prayer ... "
her eyes widened ...
she knew there was no escape from this one ...
because it was incorrect ... ???
he pushed her in front of him ...
she wanted to cry , but did n't find an outlet for tears ..
she walked in front of munkar and nakir in a long tunnel until she got to a place similar to a prison .
...
she felt nauseous .
she wished she fainted ... but it did n't happen ...
she continued to examine the terrifying place ...
in every spot there was screaming and blood ...
wailing and destruction ...
bones breaking ...
bodies burning ...
and cruel faces , from whose hearts mercy had been removed , not answering all this pleading .
the two angels pushed her from behind and she walked , feeling her feet would no longer hold her ...
she found herself getting closer to a man lying on his back ...
and an angel with a cold rigid face was standing exactly above his head ...
holding a heavy rock ...
in front of her eyes the angel threw the rock at the man 's head , which was smashed and separated from his body , rolling along ...
she screamed ...
she wept ...
then she was inflicted with great shock which restrained her tongue .
in no time , the head returned to its owner ,
and the angel went back to throwing the rock at him .
' here ' , she was told , ' come on , lie down beside this man ' - what ?
come on ...
she was forcefully pushed .
she began to resist ...
and resist ...
and resist ...
no use ...
her destiny is bleak ...
really bleak ...
she lied down , with fear about to rip her guts .
she called out to her lord for help .
she found all doors of supplication closed .
the time of seeking help during hardships has gone ...
if only she had supplicated during times of ease ...
if only she had supplicated during her life ...
if only she could return to say a couple of prayers .
just two , that would intervene for her ...
she looked above and saw an angel standing over her .
holding a wild rock in his hand .
saying to her : this is your punishment till the day of judgement , because you used to sleep through your duties .
when desperation overwhelmed her , she saw a young man , like the round moon , making his way towards her ...
feelings of hope overcame her ...
his face was full of joy and his smile lighted everything around him .
the young man arrived and reached out , stopping the angel .
he said : what has brought you ?
i have been sent for her , to protect her and prevent you .
is this an order from allah almighty ?
yes ...
she could n't believe her eyes .
the angel left , he disappeared and the young man with the beautiful face remained .
is she dreaming ?
the young man extended his hand out to her .
she got up ...
she asked him with gratitude : who are you ?
i am the supplication of your righteous son and his charity on your behalf .
ever since you passed away , he has n't stopped supplicating for you , till allah manifested his supplication in the best image , and gave it permission to respond and come here ...
she sensed munkar and nakir again ...
she turned to face them
they said to her : look .. this is your place in hell , allah has replaced it with a place in heaven .
( ( and a righteous son who supplicates to him ) ) .

< headline > method of converting cassette tapes to cd
< poster > mr. abuein
after the coming of the cassette era , it became close to impossible to free our homes of the tapes .
due to the ease of use of cassette tapes , they became prevalent at home , in cars , in offices , and everywhere .
some of these tapes were originals , recorded in a professional way and of a higher cost , while others were recorded at home . these recordings might be valuable for their sentimental associations , copies of a song or other reasons .
now we have entered the digital era , but that does n't mean we need to negate our memories
it is possible to transfer these audio recordings , whether they are on cassette tape , quarter - inch tape or on record , and convert them to a digital mp3 format on digital discs . this will make it possible to listen to them on computer or cd player , and send them anywhere via e - mail . "
preparing the devices and tools :
to be able to convert cassette recordings to digital format on compact discs , you must set up your computer with the necessary tools and programs , in order for it to be capable of the job . in addition to this , you must have a relatively new computer , equipped with a sound card .
to begin , you must connect your cassette player to the computer . this is usually done using a common cable , as explained in the picture below . this cable is available at any store that sells electrical appliance accessories and is usually cheap .
one end of the cable should be connected to line - out , and the other end must be connected to the line - in of the computer sound card .
you also need a program able to record the audio signal coming through the line - in of the sound card .
one of the best and easy to use programs is music match jukebox , which has many practical capabilities , and , most importantly , can be found free online .
download and install this program on your computer .
you can visit the program 's website to download it onto your system . the website is : http://www.musicmatch.com/
or from this link . its size is 9 megabytes . click here to download the program .
to be able to use the recording anywhere and to save the considerable space audio takes up on the hard disk , it is best to have a cd burner .
cd burners are also able to read cds .
these devices use two types of discs . both these types are able to record audio information or data related to computer programs .
the first is writable discs , and the second is rewritable .
the second type is better , but higher in price , by a couple of times , than the first .
starting the job :
step one :
after you have installed the musicmatch program and connected the stereo with the sound card via the mentioned cable , you can start recording by following the steps below :
run musicmatch program .
from the top menu , select in sequence : options , then recorder , then source , then line - in , as shown in the following picture .
now a new window will be displayed under the first window . if it does not appear , click the rec button .
in this window you will see the two words album and artist . click them , and edit the name of the new album name that you will create .
now , click on the record button ( rec ) in this window , and start playing the cassette tape on your stereo .
when the recording finishes , click the stop button .
the recording should be finished and saved in the program 's music library .
you can repeat these steps for any other recording .
recordings are automatically saved at a rate of 128kbps , which is more than enough for most cassette recordings that require high quality .
once the first recording finishes , you must check it and make sure .
if the recording is distorted or too soft , you can adjust the input volume level from the stereo to the computer , or by using windows itself .
at the bottom of the screen , on the taskbar , you will see a speaker icon " like a trumpet " . double - click it , and adjust the volume using " play control " or " volume control " .
the " record control " window will be displayed . select options , then properties , then recording , and finally ok . select the volume level required .
make sure you do n't use the mute button , otherwise you wo n't get anything at the end .
in this program , you can use extra options related to recording to adjust the various aspects and improve the audio . to do this , select from the menu options , then settings , then recorder , then advanced .
in this box , select the sound effect you desire , such as faders or others , so you can produce mp3 recordings like those of professionals .
with more experience in this program and frequent use , you will become more knowledgeable , and the task of converting old analogue recordings to digital will become easier and faster .
after preparing your mp3 audio track , whose total duration should be 74 minutes at most , you can start making an audio compact disc .
step two :
after selecting and gathering enough mp3 recordings , you can put them in a list to be recorded on the compact disc , organized as you desire .
on the right hand side of the musicmatch jukebox window , you will find the recording list .
to copy a song or musical track to this list , you can use the mouse to drag any file from the music library to this window .
in general , compact discs ( cds ) contain up to 74 minutes of audio . ( musicmatch programs are n't compatible with the new 80 minute cds )
after preparing the musical tunes you want to record on the disc , click the cd button . a new window or box will be displayed , containing many options for recording the cd .
make sure you select audio ( default ) as the type of cd you want to make . if you select the other option , you will be able to store more than 600 megabytes on the disc , but this type does not work with common cd players .
the status bar displayed at the bottom of the screen informs us how much space is left on the disc .
you can add to and remove from the list of recordings you wish to record on the cd by using " test then write cd " , in order to produce a more refined cd .
you might also want to leave a second or more between the tracks .
when you are ready to copy , put a blank cd in the cd burner , and click " create cd . "

< headline > for allah 's sake , please read before deleting

for allah 's sake , please read before deleting .
look at allah 's mercy upon you and fear him .
examine allah 's mercy upon you , so you may learn humility and examine his kindness and concern for you .
allah says in a sacred hadith : " between myself , humankind and jinn is a gaping chasm
i create and others are worshipped .
i provide and others are thanked .
my good deeds to creatures are rewarded with their evil ones .
i provide them with bounties to get closer to them , although i can dispense with them .
they distance themselves from me through sin , while they are in dire need for me .
those who remember me will be in my company , he who wants to be near me must remember me .
the people who obey me are those who love me .
i do n't exclude the disobedient from my mercy . if they repent to me then i 'm their beloved , and if they refuse then i 'm their discipliner , afflicting them with calamities to purify them from faults . whichever of them comes to me in repentance , i receive him from far away and whoever turns his face away from me , i call him from nearby saying : ' where are you going ? '
do you have another lord besides me ?
a good deed , i reward tenfold and more . an evil deed , i punish once and forgive . by my majesty and glory , if they asked pardon for them , i would forgive them . "
send it to one person at least , to help spread it , so you may receive the reward for whoever reads it .

< headline > new site steals limelight from google
< poster > mr. abuein
one thousand new members daily .
the new site myspace steals the limelight from google .
www.myspace.com
a new rising star has been shining lately in the internet world , particularly after it was successful in making for itself a name that reverberated widely in technical circles .
this newcomer has attracted many visitors and users in the span of only two years , surpassing all expectations , with the number of its users and visitors exceeding that of internet giant google by a factor of two and a half .
the new myspace site has asserted its existence and become one of the most important communities on the internet .
the secret to the site 's success lies in the transformation of its predecessor 's mistakes into strengths , and this has made it very attractive to the youth market , and in particular , to students and musicians , because it allows them to fully interact with their friends and make the most of services provided by other sites available in one place .
some may question the secret to the site 's success , given that it is not the only one in its field . but , quite simply , why would users turn to other sites when all their friends are on myspace , particularly given the encouragement and insistence the users receive from their friends to join them there ?
it also surpasses its competitors in its ability to be individualized , which allows the user to give his / her page a personal touch through the use of background colors , sketches , pictures , videos and lots of other characteristics .
the site has introduced a new way of communicating with your acquaintances and friends . the special homepage has abolished the need to download emails and chat programs . through this page the user can access chat and private emails , and also listen to their teachers and lecturers .
amidst all this success , the danger of the internet for teenagers emerges to throw its shadows on the success of the site , particularly when the number of underaged participants accounts a quarter of the total number of users .
many school students around the united states have been suspended after threatening their school mates via the site . moreover , police in one state discovered illicit / unlawful relationships involving underaged children , who were introduced via the site to men falsely claiming to be much younger than they actually were . this has forced some parents and guardians to ban their children from using the site for fear of them being exposed to these dangers .
however , this has not deterred the owners of the site from making further developments , equipping it with global / international services to expand its user base , and to attract users from all over the world , raising the banner of " we will do anything to keep our users " .

< headline > this is love
< poster > yamuslim - owner < msm77777 @ ... >
this is love .
raissiah : general : wednesday 9 muharram 1427h - february 8 2006 ad , the islamic agenda :
so that muslims know the importance of their prophet , god 's blessings and peace be upon him ..... and for their knowledge about true love towards this great prophet ....... come these stands
abu bakr , agreed by god ...
here are the sentiments , expressed by the heart of our master abu bakr , in the words reading :
our master abu bakr says : we were migrating , and i was extremely thirsty . i brought a container of milk and presented it to the prophet , god 's prayers and peace upon him , and said to him : " drink , o prophet of god ! "
abu bakr says : the prophet drank until i was satiated .
do not be misled by your eyes
... and the word was true and intended . and this was how it was reported by abu bakr el siddiq .
did you taste the beauty of this love ?
it is a special kind of love .
where are we from this love ! ?
listen to this and do n't be overwhelmed .
it is love
the love of the prophet , more than yourself , ,
the day of mecca 's occupation , abu qahafa ( the father of our lord abu bakr ) converted to islam . his conversion was very late and he was blind . our lord abu bakr took him to the prophet , to proclaim his conversion to islam and his allegiance to the prophet , god 's blessings and peace upon him .
the prophet said : o abu bakr ! you should have left the old man at home , we could have gone to him .
abu bakr replied : but you are more worthy to be visited , o prophet ofgod !
so abu qahafa converted to islam , and our lord abu bakr el siddiq wept .
he was told ; this is a joyous day , your father has converted to islam and has been saved from fire , why do you cry ?
imagine .. what did abu bakr say ?
he said : i would have preferred that the person who swore allegiance to the prophet now to be abu talib , because this would have been more pleasing to the prophet . praise god ! his wish for the happiness of the prophet was greater than his joy for his father .
where are we now , from all this ?
omar , ( who found grace in the eyes of god ) said : we were on a stroll with the prophet and some of his companions , the prophet took my hand and we walked .
omar said : i found myself saying " i swear by god , oh messenger of god , that i love you " .
the prophet replied : more than your son , omar ?
he said : yes .
he said : more than your family , omar ?
i said yes .
he said : more than your wealth , omar ?
i said yes .
he said : more than yourself , omar ?
i said no. ( take a look at his honesty with himself and with the prophet , god 's blessings and peace be upon him . )
the prophet said : no , omar , your faith will not be complete until you love me more than yourself .
omar said : i left , meditated and returned shouting , " by god , o emissary of god , i love you more than myself ! "
the prophet said : now , omar , now .
abdullah bin omar said : what did you do , father , to return with this decision ?
omar said : oh son , i went out asking myself who i was going to need most on the day of redemption , myself or god 's emissary ?
i found that my need for him was greater than my need for myself .
i remembered how i was in perdition and god saved me through him .
abdullah bin omar told him : o father , even if you forget everything about god 's emissary , what is the thing that you will never forget ?
omar said : if i ever forget , i will never forget the day when i went to him asking for his permission to go on pilgrimage .
he told me : do not forget us in your prayers , my brother .
and he said a word that pleased me more than anything in the world .
it 's not only the reader who will feel these words .
they are , by god , feelings which need a heart full of love for the prophet , god 's blessings and peace upon him , to be received as they are ... eyes closed and fresh .
thawban , loved by god .
the prophet was away for the whole day from our lord thawban , his servant . when he came back , thawban told him : i missed you , o emissary of god , and wept .
the prophet asked him : is this what makes you cry ?
thawban said : no , emissary of god , but i remembered your position in paradise , and mine , and feared the worst ,
and god 's words descended ( those who obey god and his prophet are among those for whom god provided prophets , the speakers of truth , and the martyrs , and the good people will be treated as companions ) . from the surat " women " .
sawad , loved by god .
sawad bin ouziah , the day of the battle of ohod , was standing in the middle of the army . the prophet addressed the army and said : be mature and honest .
the prophet noticed that sawad was undisciplined .
and the prophet told him : toe the line , sawad .
sawad said : yes , god 's emissary , he stood but was still not disciplined .
we heard a moaning sound from the young man , to leave the prophet ,
the prophet came , saluted with his stick , and poked sawad in his stomach .
sawad said : that hurt , o emissary god , god did really send you to lead me .
when they built him a pedestal , the young man left and went to it .
and we found the prophet , coming down from the pedestal , returning to the young man !
he said : toe the line , sawad .
the prophet ( pbuh ) used to give his sermons at the mosque , before the erection of the pedestal , near a tree trunk , and was seen by the assembly . the prophet stood , holding the young man .
what is your opinion about this love ?
and finally , do not strive to be less than the young man .
he said : oh emissary of god ! i believe that this day is a day of martyrdom , and i am elated that in my last commitment to you , your skin touches mine .
the prophet replied to him : do you not wish to be buried here with me in paradise ?
the young man fell silent .
sawad embraced the prophet 's abdomen , kissing it , and said : this is my wish .
the prophet freed his abdomen and said : repent , o sawad .

< headline > why does quran mostly address males ?
< poster > yamuslim - owner < msm77777 @ ... >
http://www.islamtoday.net/questions/show_question_content.cfm?id=102303
headline : why does quran mostly address males ?
the respondent is doctor mohammed bin hussein al-jizani , member of the teaching board in the islamic university in al-medina al-nabaweya .
new classification , date : 01/12/1427 a.h.
question : in the quran , we usually find allah addressing men , and the same is true of the prophet 's hadith . why so ?
answer : praise be to allah , peace and blessings be upon the messenger of allah , and now ...
this question has been asked by the mother of the faithful um salma - may allah look kindly upon her - when she said : " i asked the prophet - peace and blessings be upon him - : ' why are n't we mentioned in the quran as much as men ? ' "
allah 's words were revealed : " lo ! men who surrender unto allah , and women who surrender , and men who believe and women who believe ... " [ al-ahzab : 35 ] . on the authority of ahmed ( 26575 ) and the al-tabari interpretation ( 22/10 ) .
since the holy quran was revealed in the language of arabs , and came in the same style as their speech , women are included in the speech directed at men ; because arabs set masculine over feminine .
one would say : " enter and exit " , in addressing all those present , males and females .
it would n't be correct in arabic to say : enter ( male ) and enter ( female ) , exit ( male ) and exit ( female ) .
it is clear from the evidence and purposes of sharia that calling for adherence to sharia duties is as much the responsibility of men as of women , so both are so commanded , addressed , held accountable , rewarded and punished .
this is the uniform basis and general rule , and in that males and females are on a par .
however , there are some rules only applicable to males , like prohibiting gold and silk and the compulsory performance of friday prayer and jihad .
just as there are some rules only applicable to females like hijab , taking care of children and other rules which the nature of each gender necessitates . allah knows best .

< headline > sword unsheathed upon the insulters of the messenger
< poster > mohamed khawas < mmakhawas @ ... >
allah 's wrath upon he who muslims cannot exact revenge upon , such as he who insults or hurts the messenger .
sheikh al-islam ibn taymiyya said : " and the wrath of allah upon those who muslims cannot punish for insulting allah and his messenger ; allah will take revenge on him for his messenger and saves him from it ...
and the story about allah destroying these insulters one by one is known and narrated by people in history and exegesis . they are , as has been told , from the heads of quraish ; among them is al-walid ibn al-mughira , al-ass bin wail , al-aswadan bin al-mutallib , ibn abd yaghouth and al-harith bin qays .
the prophet ( peace and blessings be upon him ) wrote to kisra and qaysar and neither accepted islam . but qaysar honored the edict of the messenger of allah ( peace & blessings upon him ) and honored the messenger , so his rule remained firm , and it is said that rule belongs to his descendants to this day . "
kisra tore the letter of the messenger of allah ( peace & blessings be upon him ) , mocked the messenger of allah ( peace be upon him ) , so allah killed him after a while , stripped him of his reign , and there has since been no rule in the family , and this allah knows best .
consider the common saying : " the flesh of scholars is poisoned " , then imagine the flesh of the prophets , peace be upon them .
it is in the sahih of the prophet , peace and blessings be upon him , that he said " allah the exalted says : " he who shows enmity towards a friend of mine , whoever he is i shall be at war with him " . so imagine he who shows enmity towards the prophets ?
and whoever it is , he shall be at war with allah .
if you read the stories of the prophets in the qur'an , you find that peoples were destroyed if they hurt the prophets or confronted them with obscene words or actions . the people of israel were one such group , humiliation was forced upon them because they deserved allah 's wrath , and they were shown no mercy for unjustly killing the prophets and pagan impiety , as allah mentioned in his book .
you will not find anyone who hurt a prophet and did not repent , for allah would inflict upon them a calamity .
we have mentioned that muslims have tried to hasten revenge upon the infidels if they resorted to insulting the messenger of allah , peace & blessings be upon him , and we witnessed such a thing in many different cases . this is a vast field that cannot be comprehended , and we did not intend to mention it here , but rather make clear the legislative rule .
similar to this is what has been narrated to us by just muslims from among people with expertise in jurisprudence about what happened when they tried many times to surround fortresses and cities on the coast of damascus . they spoke of the muslims who surrounded them : " we used to surround a fortress or city for a month or more , usually unable to conquer them , and we would be about to give up , and then it 's people would curse the messenger of allah , peace and blessings upon him , and insult his dignity , and then the conquest would happen faster and more easily , and would not be delayed more than a day or two or from that time . " then the place would be conquered by force , causing a great massacre . they said : " we used to receive good news about the hastening of the conquest when we heard them insult him , while our hearts were full of anger because of what they said about him .
a similar story was told to me by some trustworthy fellows , that muslims in morocco are in the same situation with the christians , the rule of allah is that sometimes he punishes his enemies himself , and at another times it happens at the hands of his faithful servants .
allah , the exalted , protects and saves him in every way from harm and the insults of people , even in words :
in the saheehayn from abu huraira the messenger of allah , peace and blessings upon him , said : " does it not astonish you how allah protects me from the quraish 's abuse and curses ? they abuse mudhammam , and curse , while i am mohammed " . allah elevated his name and title above insult and directed the curse at the insulter .
what proves that insult is a great crime , being a sign infidelity and enmity - it is both - is that the prophet , peace and blessings upon him , used to forgive those of the hypocrites who hurt him , as clarified earlier , even though he had the right to kill them , as mentioned earlier in abu bakr and others narrations .
if insult were merely apostasy , then the offender should be killed like any apostate . it is known that the right of the prophet , peace and blessings upon him , in forgiving him can have priority over insult .
proof that insult is a singlular crime : if a dhimmi insulted one of the muslims or mu'aahadin and breached the covenant , the insult of that man would have been a crime for which he deserved a punishment unlike that of breaching the covenant ; the insulting of the messenger of allah , peace and blessings be upon him , is less serious than insulting one of the people ?
he also said : " purifying the land of insults to the messenger of allah , peace and blessings upon him , is obligatory so far as possible , because it is part of spreading the religion of allah and upholding the word of allah . since the whole religion is dedicated to allah , whenever there appears an insult to him , and amends are not sought from he who produced it , the religion will not be spread and nor will the word of allah be held high . in addition , it should be purified from fornicators , thiefs and bandits according to one 's ability , different than purifying it from infidelity which is not obligatory due to the permissibility of people of the book testifying !!!!!!!
the land must be purified of every crime according to one 's ability , and a set punishment assigned to the one committing it , in islamic law , if it does n't have a certain !!!

( 1 ) this was during his time , may allah be merciful upon him .
the mockery of qaysar 's descendants to the messenger of allah , peace and blessings upon him , during our time , is good news concerning the end of their kingship and rule , with the permission of allah .

< headline > mentioning name of allah in toilet
< poster > kg < ghazyk @ ... >
is a muslim allowed to read the qur'an , or mention the name of allah , in his heart ( in contemplation ) , without uttering it , in the bathroom ?
the answer :
thanks be to allah
1. there are two ways to extol allah : verbal extolment , such as reading the qur'an and glorification and supplications , which believers are encouraged to apply according to sharia ; and secondly , extolment in the heart , which is done in contemplation of allah 's majesty and powers , and of the creatures of allah , the glorious and exalted , or by reciting the qur'an in silence . there is no reward in the latter , however , as the reward is linked to reading the qur'an , which is done only with the tongue . the same is true of supplications , it is necessary to utter them out loud ; it is not enough to keep them in the heart .
scholars have differentiated between the two forms of extolment , saying that it is loathsome to mention allah out loud in the bathroom , due to allah 's glorified status . as for extolment in the heart , it is not abhorred and there is no harm in it .
the difference between the two types is indicated by the fact that scholars have agreed that a person in a serious state of impurity is allowed to recite the qur'an by heart , but reciting it aloud is prohibited .
al-nawawi said : " it is agreed that if a person in a serious state of impurity contemplates the qur'an in his heart without using his tongue , he would not be committing the prohibited act of reciting by such a person . " al-nawawi 's interpretation in sahih muslim ( 103/4 ) .
ibn al-munthir reported in al-awsat : " and ekrema said that allah 's name is not to be exalted by mouth while in the toilet , rather it should be exalted in the heart . " al-awsat ( 341/1 ) .
the permanent committee stated : " it is part of islamic rituals for a man to remember his creator whenever he wants to enter the toilet or the bathroom , by saying before entering : " oh allah , i seek refuge in you from evil and maliciousness " , and not to mention allah 's name after he enters , but to stop mentioning his name as soon as he enters . " permanent committee fatwas " ( 93/5 ) .
sheikh abdel - aziz bin baz said : " extolment in the heart is allowed at all times and places , in the bathroom or outside it , but what 's abhorred is , in the bathroom and its likes , to practice extolment of the tongue to glorify allah , except for mentioning of the name of allah during ablution , which one should do if one has trouble performing ablution outside the bathroom , as it is a duty according to some scholars , and a confirmed sunnah according to the majority . " sheikh ibn baz fatwas " ( 408/5 ) and allah is the omniscient .
