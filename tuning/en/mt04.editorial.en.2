the alleged ( or forced ) " brothers " conclude their claims by silencing those who assume their position and by plugging their ears instead of their talking .
they imagine , or delude themselves , that the french moslems are either lacking in their islam or they are helpless .
they would need sheikh ahmad al-zain , the " sunni " ( hanafi shafie ) islamic law judge in sidon , or those like him ( " al-hayat " on the 6th of this month ) to restore for them their rights to guidance and knowledge or to resolve and fortitude .
perhaps this is the crux of the problem and the issue .
the " guide " al-hudhaibi , sheikh yousef al-qardhawi , sheikh mohammad rasheed qabbani , " sheikh " mohammad khatami , sheikh mohammad hussein fadhlallah and sheikh ahmad kaftaro , and others who concur with them , contend that moslems , either by birth or by heritage , are moslems whose matter of their belief and faith does not revert to them , the moslems themselves , but rather to " scholars " and people of the fatwa .
media outlets widely reported the comments of his eminence sheikh sayyed al-tantawi , the sheikh of al-azhar , may god guide him and guide us to success , with regards to the french governments banning moslem women from covering their heads when they go to school . his eminences statement alluded that it is the french governments right to do so when he said : " if a moslem woman was in a country other than the state of islam , such as the country of france , and the officials there decided to enact laws that contradict with the issue of the veil for the moslem woman , it is their right .
it is their right .
it is their right , and i repeat , it is their right that i cannot object to , " ( " al-hayat " on 31/12/2003 ) .
in fact , when i read the comments of his eminence the sheikh of al-azhar , i found them very odd .
as he is a respectable islamic figure , and his position carries a heavy weight in the whole world .
i have met with him more than once , including my visit with him at his office in the month of november in the year 1997 , when he endowed us with his gentle manners and tolerant treatment , and we have benefited from his perspective on the issues that we discussed and which emanates from deep knowledge .
for that , the astonishment of the aforementioned statement was great .
the strong growth that the private sector witnessed last year was accompanied by several factors that have led to boosting confidence in the national economy , and they are expected to reflect positively on the private sector 's growth rates for the current year as well .
among these factors are the decline of interest rates on deposits in local currency to match the declining interest rates of the dollar , and to permit local and foreign private sectors to invest in natural gas production projects and in power and water projects as well as to privatize a portion of the " saudi telecommunications " company 's shares .
the saudi stock market performance was good last year as the market index rose by a rate of 76.2 percent supported by low local interest rates and high liquidity levels , in addition to the return of some saudi capital assets from abroad and the good results of the listed saudi companies .
it is expected that governmental expenditures in the year 2004 also will exceed the levels estimated in the budget , which means that the government will follow the same expansionist financial policy that it had followed last year . this will lead to the growth of the governmental sector by a rate of 2 percent , while the saudi private sector is expected to grow by a rate of 4 percent supported by low interest rates and surplus liquidity volume .
the growth of the non - oil sectors , whether governmental or private , will compensate for the expected negative growth of the oil sector so that the growth rate of the gross national product will reach 2 percent in constant prices this year .
after kuwait realized a growth in the gross national product within 1 percent in constant prices in the year 2002 , this growth has risen to about 4 percent last year .
do the iraqi secularists realize that the united states has for a long time exploited the elements of backwardness produced by the humiliating pursuit of the ways of the west - and in particular , secularism - which some among us are advocating ?
she has painted them as elements of weakness in the people of the arab and islamic region that can be used to control the " middle east " region and to rob it of its natural resources ?
therefore , specialized american study centers are seeking to show research that paints the " third world " as not having a scientific mind capable of utilizing its natural resources , especially oil !
evidence is a plenty for anyone who wants it .
this policy is characterized by dominance , greed and interests .
it is an old policy in western thinking that began since socrates and his two students , plato and aristotle , attempted to hypothesize the philosophy of dominance and control over others through advocating the superiority of the western being , which is the basis for all dominations .
that is why renowned economist adam smith has openly said : " if every ( western ) individual would follow his individual interest , public prosperity would have been assured . "
the demand by the kurdish leadership for a federation , before free elections throughout iraq , is solid evidence of the kurdish leadership 's fear of the will of the kurdish people , and not of the minorities that infiltrate the so - called iraq 's kurdistan .
the evidence for that is that the leadership has not , for 12 years , held elections , despite its feasibility every year .
so , what has the kurdistan government offered the kurdish people , except perhaps for infighting between the sheikhs of the barazani and the talabani clans at the expense of kurdish blood ?
they have sold out this blood for 40 years .
as usual , when fighting breaks out between al-barazani and al-talabani , it does not stop until a third party intervenes .
and it is known , this permanent peace between them arrived late through the american mediator .
so if fighting breaks out between them while they are within the borders of their federation , who would intervene to stop the shedding of the kurdish people 's blood ?
the economic picture for the majority of egyptians since the liberation decision and until now has had an impact under a conviction that any crisis can be addressed or its severity lessened except for the " confidence crisis , " which when exacerbated , would not return to normal easily , since the current atmosphere is a fertile ground to do that in the absence of open discussion of the current situation and involving the citizen seriously in setting the priorities .
however , the two sides , the citizen and the government , must consider the consequence of the " bilateral boycott " which has not been put forward at the street level since the bread crisis in the year 1977 .
every government has its own problems and its crises , but in the end , it is a citizen embracer since the government of mamdouh salem in the early seventies through the governments of fouad muheiddine , kamal hassan ali , ali lutfi , atif suddqi and kamal al-ganzouri .
but the current government is being viewed suspiciously by the citizen , as if it is the cause of his problems , ailments and pains , although the citizen himself represents a big part of the problems .
the population problem is getting worse , the way of thinking about life is deteriorating , and the attraction to life 's luxuries is rising without consideration to the nature of income and its worth .
the majority of citizens contend that the tone of boredom and impatience with the government interplays under a clear failure in addressing the crisis of rising prices , which are continually rising without a corresponding increase in citizens ' incomes , keeping in mind that since the beginning of july 2003 , prices have risen at a rate of 40 percent on the average so far .
despite president hosni mubarak 's repeated and decisive directives regarding the need to ease the citizens ' conditions and intensifying meetings with the economic group , the government is handling the decisions without proper execution , which has led some to finally demand that the party intervene to cooperate with the government in order to arrive at solutions .
mr. jihad al-khazen ( " al-hayat " on 22/1/2004 ) has adamantly determined that libya 's recent decision to remove the weapons of mass destruction is false under the pretext that its timing was not appropriate and that it has created pressures on countries like egypt , syria and iran .
the aforementioned person adamantly determined that this decision was just a compliance with the american stick policy , citing as evidence the recent declaration of some american officials about the value of the stick policy , by which afghanistan and iraq were handled , in libya 's recent decision - making .
he cited a number of fabricated events and distorted statements to prove that there is some libyan - israeli rapprochement that is emerging in the horizon .
finally , he did not neglect to drive a wedge by trying to imply that colonel kaddafy 's aid to the palestinians has only gone to the radical palestinian wings .
he ridiculed the libyan leadership by determining that it has helped egypt by imposing visas on egyptians who wish to enter libya , just as he had helped the palestinians before by expelling them to the borders .
the recent libyan decision - making to remove the weapons of mass destruction and its timing are a matter that only concerns libya .
she knows better what suits her interests and what contradicts them .
when talk about the shrinking of the israeli deterrent power and its decline becomes a basic part in the public speech of the israeli government and its branches , the matter requires prudence and caution of new adventures by sharon , mofaz and their army commanders to rehabilitate the deteriorating israeli psyche and a deterrent power that has been hit in the core .
palestinians must first take that into consideration , although israel has turned them into an experimental field and tried all kinds of weapons against them . however , the palestinian leadership , people and factions must exercise caution .
" hezbollah " , its leadership and the whole of lebanon must exercise caution of this " wounded beast " becoming loose .
syria and its leadership must be alert to new raids that are more ferocious and more deep into syrian territories .
the leaders of the palestinian factions must exercise caution .
at any rate , and even if you accept the opinion of the iraqi minister of trade on face value , the return to the past is not useful . what is needed is to exit the current political and security predicament and restore iraq 's independence .
i have talked with mr. allawi and listened to him without agreeing , despite my appreciation of his personal ability and his demeanor .
here i find myself again in disagreement with the governing council . it comprises , in my personal judgment , seven or eight members of untarnished patriots among whom specifically is adnan pachachi , who i mention in his capacity as the president of the governing council for this month .
yet , there is a majority of brokers and opportunists who returned to iraq on the back of an american tank , and they work for themselves , not for the good of iraq and the iraqis .
some of the governing council members know that they will be finished if elections are held , and therefore , they oppose holding them . the reader needs only follow the suggestions of some of the council 's members , such as the suggestion to expand it to replace the proposed national general assembly .
exactly a year ago , powell presented the terror scenario at the security council by his declaration of " huge " quantities of biological and chemical weapons in iraq 's possession and of relations between the iraqi regime and the " al-qaeda " network .
he talked about baghdad 's efforts to possess nuclear weapons and the existence of huge quantities of materials such as " anthrax " and nerve gas .
on that day , powell turned into a façade for the hawks who orchestrated the war scenario before creating its justifications , so he presented the terror scenario on their behalf at the international venue .
this week , powell spoke with two different tones : he doubted that he would have the same position supporting the war had he been told that this country did not possess an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction .
he stressed that the invasion of iraq was " the right decision " and justified the invasion because of iraq 's " intentions " , her capabilities to manufacture the weapons and with the dangers of her regime - regardless of the weapons stock .
colin powell is a " soldier " who commits to loyalty , and he is the secretary of state in an administration whose president wants to be re - elected .
so he is relatively excused , although history will punish him later .
what has been merely a lie in america has turned into a bombing over the heads of people outside of it , an endless war and a continuous epic called " pax americana . "
the issue is not related to the secret of politics as it seems to intelligent writers such as christopher hutchins who shifts from left to right with the shifting of the intelligentsia center of gravity from left to right , with the transformation toward identity policies in the third world , and with the extinction of the universal language that is shared with the democratic powers in the west .
hutchins believes that keeping the secret by " wise men " and their knowledge of the real objective of the war , which cannot be revealed except via treatments , adaptations , maneuvers and plotting , is what makes the play appealing to intelligent people such as wolfowitz .
the truth is that it is also what makes christopher hutchins writings appealing , and there is nothing more to it than that .
it is also a consumption of scandals and secrets , but it is a classy consumption for the elite .
policy cannot be run this way .
dreaming politicians and those who monopolize the ready - made facts , such as the new conservatives , are using political maneuvering and deception for a purpose that they believe is noble .
mr. ali al-sistani seized an american promise and stuck to it : a promise for establishing democracy and holding of elections that will be the basis for the democratic system .
with this position , he is helping the americans and the members of the governing council be serious .
it is the first test for the credibility of promising the region with democracy .
mr. al-sistani had taken his first step , as an authority for the religious majority in iraq , with his demand for an elected commission for writing a new constitution .
with that , he did not stray away from what all iraqis are seeking , nor did he divert from the democratic frameworks that the americans are seeking to establish in iraq .
the constitution is an expression of a domestic situation despite the universality of today 's constitutions .
under this connotation , the constitution should not displease anyone as to make him divert from his peaceful way of demanding his rights since constitutions are a guarantee for not setting off violence , and a guarantee for peaceful interaction and for the stability of the state and the community , as is the case in the constitutions of existing democracies .
al-sistani took his second democratic step following the announcement of the date and mechanism of transferring power to the governing council , which is what the united states means by " the iraqis . "
yet , suspicion quickly spread that there is some pre - meditated intention to go around the iraqi people 's will , and sign off the emerging democracy in the name of the governing council alone and with whomever is known for loyalty to it and to america directly .
the legislative development was big and momentous , but it is noted that this legislative development came in europe to follow and affirm the jurisprudence of the courts , while this development came in the arab countries to force the courts to change their directions while the courts stayed disobedient !
the judiciary in the arab countries is still under the belief that arbitration does not take away its jurisdiction , but it does take away its power !
this frustrates the effect sought by legislators when they amended the laws of arbitration and leads international arbitrations to stay away from the arab countries and shift to the european countries where the judiciary is discreet about protecting the freedom of contracting and the freedom of arbitration .
but what do we notice in the arab countries ?
saudi arabia : after the passing of the new saudi arbitration law , the religious courts still consider that the arbitration stipulation does not take away their jurisdiction and they still are proceeding with litigation despite the arbitration stipulation and despite the insistence of one of the conflict sides on arbitration .
it is something that goes back one step then goes forward two steps and still has not been decided yet despite the explicitness of the modern saudi arbitration law which recognizes the arbitration stipulation .
syria : an international arbitration ruling has been announced between the ( swiss ) company " stahl ag steel und eloise " and the syrian " general fertilizer company , " a government corporation .
the image that was shown on the screens was vivid .
abdul qadeer khan , the father of the pakistani nuclear bomb , came to president pervez musharraf and put the matter into his hands .
he presented him with a bomb that is hard for the president to escape its harm .
in his military uniform , he looked somber and confused .
for what khan has said was serious , very serious .
he simply admitted the other side .
he swam for long in the nuclear black market .
he entered the bazaar and travelled far .
he leaked secrets and information to iran , libya and north korea .
musharraf 's stares reflected the gravity of his position .
he knows that pakistanis love this man more than him .
they view him as the man who liberated the scared pakistan from her old complex toward india .
he gave that anxious country , which was born out of a bloody separation , a sense of relief and that she , after today , will no longer be threatened or weakened .
he gave her a sense of power and dignity .
the " fateh " movement was born 39 years ago .
its first bullets protected the cause from being forgotten and outlined the landmarks of the road .
but the world in which it was born no longer exists .
and the conflict in which it was involved witnessed transformations and changes .
that 's why it was not strange that it got confused after all of these junctions .
and it is not strange that it witnessed the handing in of resignations and the spreading of accusations .
no one can deny the role of " fateh " .
and no one can deny the role of yasser arafat .
but it is the right of every supporter of the palestinian cause to question whether the " fateh " leadership made , in the face of all external and internal challenges , all the decisions that should have been made .
no names of prominent leaders were listed in the resignation letter offered by 400 middle fateh cadres .
but the letter pointed in one paragraph to the extent of the confusion plaguing the movement whose role is indispensable in the confrontation with israel or in negotiating with her .
the signatories said that the movement has begun to disintegrate from the inside due to internal disagreements .
i sit waiting for democracy because if it did not come american style , it must come to us english style .
over the span of a few days , i have followed the visit to britain by libya 's foreign minister , mr. abdel rahman shalqam , and noted that when he was asked in a press conference about the killing of policewoman evon fletcher outside the libyan embassy in london in the year 1984 , he responded by quoting the former british spy david shayler on the british intelligence attempt to assassinate colonel moammar kaddafy .
with that , britain and libya are " even " , a killing for a killing attempt , and i still have to hear the opinion of policewoman fletcher 's family regarding the silence of the british foreign office on the subject .
prior to that , the united states and britain had suggested to the arab leaders to follow the example of the brother colonel .
i imagine that the intention is to follow his example in stripping naked and leaving israel alone as a nuclear , chemical and germ state in the middle east .
this is a point that must be explained so that no one would come to think that what is required is to go from killing opponents and a british policewoman to terrorist acts to downing two civilian aircraft to kidnapping civilians and other things before arriving at giving up weapons of mass destruction that did not exist except in the imagination of the democratically - transformed libyan leader .
i would not bother the reader with a full article on libya , but i want some of the manifestations of democracy , the blessing of which we have missed in the middle east .
iran goes today to the polls only to come back a loser .
a quarter of a century ago , khomeini 's contentions attracted people .
they supported them and went down to the streets .
they chanted and raised their fists .
the state of the shah crumbled .
the army was dismantled , and the " savak " with it , and the entire suppression and oppression machine .
a quarter of a century after the triumph of the revolution by the people , the revolution 's regime goes to the polls afraid of them .
the matter does not relate to mohammad khatami 's future .
it was not a secret from the outset that he is a president in the administration of the guide .
the matter relates to the future of the regime , the revolution and the country .
recent weeks have revealed the extent of fear that grips the hardliners , who are concerned about the trickling of the winds into the bastion of the revolution .
they no longer can tolerate the dance of democracy despite the controls and the checks provided by the constitution .
the last word given by the constitution to the guide is no longer adequate to reassure them .
despite the hesitation and inclination for reconciliation , compromise and co - existence that plagued his conduct , mohammad khatami has planted disconcerting questions in the body of the regime .
poor paul bremer .
his suffering exceeds the ability to endure .
he was assigned to organize what is difficult to organize and to market what is impossible to market .
the iraqis did not believe that he came on a humanitarian mission and that his obsession is to make a nice future for them .
suspicion , as complaining and anger also , are traits of the iraqis .
pity , his mission is arduous .
the joy of toppling saddam did not last long .
the iraqi people returned to their basic constituents .
holding a dialogue with the " sunni triangle " is impossible .
satisfying the kurdish allies is difficult because it stirs the anger of allies and friends domestically and abroad .
he addresses the shiites in the governing council , and they point their fingers toward the najaf .
the man who sits in najaf does not receive him ; he favors the united nations over the united states .
his mission is exhausting .
time is running out .
there is no use for digging up the recent past .
and there is no use for restarting the argument over the advantage of the american war against iraq and launching it without an international authorization as well as the principle of pre - emptive war .
that is why george bush discussed with his guest , gerhard schroeder , the present and the future and overlooked the tussles of the recent past .
it was in the interest of the american president to refute the democrats ' claims that his style of running foreign policy cost the united states european allies , including germany , which is embarking on a field role in afghanistan .
bush realizes that he will need the " contentious " europeans to encourage the united nations for a role in iraq that will facilitate for the united states the process of ending the occupation as well as the elections and the institution - building afterwards .
he will also need the contentious europeans in any potential role for the north atlantic alliance .
and because it is an election season , the master of the white house has sent signals reflecting his open - mindedness .
the american defense secretary james schlesinger summoned the british ambassador to washington , lord cromer , and informed him that the united states will not tolerate the threat of a " backward , sparsely - populated " country , and that he no longer rules out the use of military force by the united states .
he ruled out other possibilities such as replacing current stubborn arab leaders with " cooperative leaders " or threatening armed boat diplomacy .
the embargo that the arab opec member countries declared was intended to pressure the united states and other western countries to force them to withdraw from arab territories . it lasted until march 1973 ; the united states missed only 13 percent of her imported oil , but that caused her great difficulties .
schlesinger estimated that the operation would require two divisions at the outset , one for saudi arabia and one for kuwait , and perhaps a third for the emirate of abu dhabi with the help of britain .
that was 30 years ago . today 's news , all published and accurate , includes :
the kingdom of saudi arabia now produces about eight million barrels of crude oil a day , which she can raise to ten million , and she intends to maintain a production average of up to 5.1 million barrels until the year 2011 .
anyone who follows the situation in iraq has the right to question whether there 's a thread linking the bloody stabs that were dealt various parties .
he has the right to question whether the thread linking the blasts and the assassinations that target religious or political symbols is flooding the field with a bloody anarchy that kills the hope for the establishment of an iraqi authority capable of providing security and stability ?
it is also possible to question whether the blasts also aim at shaking the stability of the region in its entirety via the poisons that may be unleashed by the establishment of bloody contact lines between the basic constituents of the iraqi people .
we should not be forgetting an important question which is : has iraq merely turned into a field for wars bigger than her , especially the war launched by those who were targeted by the " war on terror " , which was launched the day after september 11 , 2001 ?
it is evident that yesterday 's massacre aimed at setting off the fire .
selecting the crime scenes and methods of execution were aimed at unleashing a series of reactions that lead to drowning iraq in a hellish cycle that would be difficult to exit .
and because the moving incitement is that serious , the iraqis ought to formulate a response that goes beyond the advice of the wise men and the denunciation and condemnation statements .
the iraqis did not accuse the american forces of involvement in the blasts that bloodied karbala and baghdad the day before yesterday .
the americans have no interest in joining an act of this nature in the first place .
such an involvement means pushing the large shiite community to enlist in the armed resistance .
it is an enlistment that could set the land of iraq on fire under the feet of the occupation .
on the contrary , the american administration seemed to imply in recent months that the bloody blows that were dealt the " coalition forces " , international headquarters and religious symbols are the make of the incoming resistance from abroad .
yesterday 's massacres came to serve what the americans seek to promote , since it is hard to believe that what happened serves the agenda of any iraqi group .
the iraqis did not accuse the americans especially after it became clear that suicide attacks contributed to the baghdad and karbala massacres .
but iraqi sides accused the americans of negligence in carrying out the responsibilities that fall on their shoulders as an occupation power .
they accused them of negligence in the security measures .
the fact is that it is hard to imagine a secure situation under an occupation even if it has set a date to end its occupation .
it is hard to mix the occupation and security , especially in this country and in this region in particular .
from today and until the summit of eight , talk will accelerate on " the greater middle east initiative " which is based on sharing the greater middle east .
this has put the cart behind the horse . it made an presumption of a cooperation between the middle east countries and israel , despite the latter 's carrying on the killing and the destruction , as if the palestinians are from another universe and their affair does not concern the arabs and the moslems in the region .
i pause to note a point of doubt for which i have no evidence except that i know who writes the american plans of the likud sharonites in the american administration surrounded by those with a sole loyalty to israel .
the point is that the purpose of the greater middle east is to bring in turkey , iran , afghanistan and pakistan so that the arabs become a minority within the plan .
but what the plan writers overlook because of their israeli blindness is that moslems may be more supportive to the palestinians than the arabs . just ask any turk , pakistani , iranian or afghani for his view on the subject .
in any case , the greater middle east initiative largely depends on the arab human development plan for the years 2002 and 2003 .
the plan had discussed three " deficiencies " in freedom , education and empowering women , and the initiative tells of three requirements which are promoting democracy , building a knowledge society and expanding economic opportunities .
america is a big problem .
her friendship is costly and her animosity is high - priced .
it is impossible for countries today to go on as if america did not exist .
she is needed to issue an international certificate of good conduct .
her endorsement of election fairness and good management of the economy is mandatory .
her signature on the government 's record in the area of human rights is a must .
she must have access to the donations of the international monetary fund and the world bank .
there is no use of seeking the help of the security council if she were not satisfied .
her emissaries ' reports are important and often decisive .
if it were n't for her military machine and her prestige , slobodan milosevic would not have been placed behind bars .
if it were n't for the impact of the same machine , saddam hussein would be living in the palace threatening the new " mother of all battles . "
she is indispensable to stop a civil war and to encourage the president to take the road to exile .
when ramon does not find something to lie about , he seeks the help of others as he in one of the chapters quotes the american defense secretary donald rumsfeld as saying that tehran helped members of al-qaeda and taliban escape via iran .
via iran to where ?
rumsfeld comments were published in january 2002 , and we know now that every charge directed by the american administration against iraq was false .
on the subject of iran in particular , she was fighting a war against the taliban after the killing of her diplomats and citizens in afghanistan , and she absolutely has nothing in common with al-qaeda and taliban .
but ramon completes the lie citing a news item written by michael evans in " the times " about an official in al-qaeda who offered to bring its members into lebanon .
israel hopes for that and sends promoters for her false hopes , but it did not and will not happen .
the booklet ends at what israel already wants as ramon proposes a political and economic pressure on syria and iran to refrain from supporting hezbollah . he seems confused in a previous chapter ; one time he says that syria 's support is more important and at another time says iran 's support is the more important .
perhaps the spanish socialist leaders do not like to hear any skepticism about the ideological or substantive aspect of the dispute instigated by the war in iraq , especially toward the french position .
the spaniards , from the right and the left , especially the left , acknowledge that spain had big interests in saddam hussein 's iraq , not the size of the huge french interests throughout the entire former reign , of course .
as they acknowledge , especially the right , the american double standards for a long time in iraq , particularly during the eighties .
in discussions with concerned spaniards , the intensity of the political and cultural dimensions of the dispute sometimes lessens the essence of the dispute over foreign policy between france and germany on one side , and washington on the other , considered basically as a struggle over interests .
anyone who wanders about not only the spanish institutions but also the streets of madrid and in barcelona next , realizes the significance of the european role in a country like spain perfectly well .
spain is a model for a country in which its more advanced european surroundings contributed to turning the wheel of its development until it has become today undoubtedly a country on an emerging and advanced economic , cultural and scientific equal footing .
even the spanish economy - within the european vehicle - has transformed from a labor - exporting economy to an economy that imports laborers with legal residence , and who in the majority are émigrés from latin america with a ratio ( about one third ) of émigrés from arab north africa countries .
the new iraqi officials , formerly opponents , are still conducting themselves , through their contacts with their counterparts in other countries , with the mentality of opponents who are in need of every aid and service from this or that country .
they do not believe or rather have not gotten used to acting as statesmen of a country that is getting ready to become better - off than it was before .
the reason for this discussion is the conduct of the iraqi officials who visited lebanon by way of syria in recent weeks , the last of which was the delegation of the governing council that was until very recently " illegitimate and does not represent the iraqi people " according to statements by top officials who received its delegation with embraces last week . praise be him who changes things !
what attracted attention in the comments of the head of the delegation , muwaffaq al-rubaei , after his meeting with the lebanese prime minister , rafiq al-hariri , is his comment that he asked him to facilitate the entry and residency of iraqis in lebanon and to discuss developing the iraqi - lebanese relations . what is more strange and naïve is his request to him for help with " improving the image of the new iraq with the arab brothers . "
does it make any sense to have such a request come from an official in a country that has all that prestige and dignity ?
and who authorized mr. al-rubaei to violate the dignity of iraqis with such a humiliating begging for iraq and its people ?
if mr. al-rubaei was not aware of the standards that rule the relations of nations , he should have at least sought the help of advisors .
we hesitated more than once before embarking on this open discussion . we have warned of the policy of making ministries a pasture for favoritisms and had previously pledged to act as a positive opposition .
an opposition that monitors the rule and the rulers and attempts to straight ten their missteps , which are regrettably too many .
an opposition which , like western oppositions , must remain strong , exactly as british prime minister tony blair wished for his country when he said that he is sad because his opposition is weak .
we assure the ministers and tell them : do not be sad , your opposition is strong thanks to your great mistakes , and it seems like they are getting greater day after day .
" the pot has spilled over " is a statement fully uttered by iraqis today as they observe with unprecedented amazement the deterioration of conditions of administrations , ministries and the governing council in the country with the spread of corruption , favoritism , briberies and deals .
such disgraces which we had thought our new iraq has let go forever are returning in a worse fashion .
even the lottery of the pilgrimage , the most sacred of rites , has been tarnished , and a poor student was deprived so that it could be given to a strong commander .
the main drive that has necessitated the reenactment of the death penalty verdicts may have been , as you have said , " to cover up the scandal of the civil war culture , the culminations of which were exposed by the records of criminals " whose lives were ended the way we witnessed on the date of january 17 , 2004 .
but such a drive may not have been the only thing that compelled officials to make the decision today to carry out the execution verdicts against criminals who were selected according to standards that relate not only to the seriousness of the committed crimes but also to their secular affiliation in order to maintain secular balances .
the implementation of the execution verdicts may also have its morals that are based on the culture of deterrence , repression and intimidation .
for it aims to create an atmosphere of terror not only in the mind of whoever thinks about committing a certain crime for various reasons , but also in the minds of those who ponder , in the authority 's opinion , the idea of freedom , liberation and opposition , toppling the regime and the current governing structure , or even the idea of rebellion in this critical period the region is going through , which frightens many of the rulers .
that 's why the message was implicit but at the same time clear , in order to learn lessons .
regarding the argument that lebanon did not become " a state of law " to abolish the death penalty : we share this view with you comfortably that lebanon has not yet become " a state of law " like western european countries , canada , japan and other countries , even though etat de droit is literally " a state of justice " in actual and european meaning of the word . the lebanese laws are considered in the majority as laws aiming to make lebanon " a state of law and institutions . "
the practical reality in which lebanon is stumbling gives a clear indication that it is , as you say , " a lawless state " or " a state of no rights . "
what is the matter with the lebanese political leaderships which we only hear uttering nothing but big words . they talk about nothing but the confrontation with israel , about the resistance , and about spreading the resistance culture while addressing lebanon 's internal crisis is supposedly the basis to start with .
how do you want to spread " the resistance culture " in the arab world while the lebanese are under the mercy of the domineering minority that only sees in their sufferings as the manifestation of frightening subordination and manliness which the citizen is forced into at all levels of his life and living welfare .
it is important to talk about the resistance , and about the resisting weapons , and as a matter of fact , it is extremely important . but what can the lebanese do when he follows the news of wholesale deals and scandals and pauses at the continuing collusion of the ruling class .
whether it is support or opposition , civil or non - civil , economic or judicial - a continuing collusion that perplexes a majority with no faction , no color , no identity , except for being helpless and almost disdained , in the secret of the domineering minority who does not see who will hold it accountable , stop it and deter it ?
we are living under the culture of political pretension and hypocrisy .
we are living under a new kind of classism .
a struggling class , a resistance class , a patriotic class , a financial class , an armed class , an intelligentsia class and a mafioso class , all feeding from the silence of people and their acceptance of the crumbs of table .
people who would accept to be ruled in accordance with a type of class standards that is sharper and more vicious than the old classes that we have long been told produced war .
no , ariel sharon the wolf did not come out of his skin .
he is beating around the bush responding to the needs of the current phase , but his fangs and his paws continue to be in an attack position .
there is a temporary need for maneuver necessitated by the personal record that is colored with bribery news and dictated , of course , by the white house visit at a time when george bush 's shares seem as if in a decline .
therefore , there is absolutely no objection to sharon detonating a loud audible bomb with reverberations reaching many places :
first : the corruption record that is tightening around him and involves his two sons omri and gilad , which means that the talk about the plan to withdraw from the settlements in gaza and the northern west bank will shift the lights shed on the corruption record to the settlement issue .
second : the united states and george bush , where it seems that the talk about the withdrawals is an attempt to say that he is implementing provisions called for by the " road map " whereas the palestinians are not implementing the provision of stopping violence and " terrorism . "
third : the positions of his radical allies in power who always tried to impose their conditions on him , despite that such conditions were not exactly in contradiction with his policies .
throughout all these years of negotiations and under the framework of the united nations " oil for food " program , the " sonatrach " company was able to participate in the marketing a part of the iraqi oil .
this way and at every stage of iraqi oil exportation stages , we have been allocated parcels equal to the parcels of other petroleum companies , including the american , through " sonatrach 's " branch in london .
all that was taking place with the knowledge and approval of the united nations , and not directly with the iraqis .
perhaps for this reason , we were invited to organize humanitarian gestures toward the iraqi people .
we also sent aid in the form of medicines , medical equipment and foodstuff .
we supervised the training of about 60 iraqi oil engineers in algeria , also opened an office in baghdad , and contributed to arranging business trips for company managers , which were two trips a year to follow up on the oil for food program in the field .
the aspects of similarity between the iranian situation during the period that followed the collapse of the shah regime in the year 1979 and the iraqi situation after america toppled the regime of saddam hussein are many .
the biggest similarity becomes apparent in the administrative chaos and the move by members of the former regime ( the shahenshahi in iran and the baathist in iraq ) to change their skins and adopt the slogans of the new order .
but in practice they are carrying on the policy of their former regime whenever they find an opening they can go through .
this situation applies to some of iraq 's embassies that were recently re - opened , giving hope to the iraqis in exile , although many of them were shocked by the reality at these embassies .
under the administration of the deposed regime , all iraqis were suffering .
internally , the ghost of war and death in the intelligence basements is chasing all people , even those who think they are accepted by the regime or involved in its policy .
abroad , the regime is pursuing hundreds of thousands who were able to escape the daily death grinder through its intelligence members and by tightening on iraqis in their exiles , the least of which is depriving them from renewing their passports or certifying their documents because the price for that will not be less than pledging to work as informers for the embassy , which is in reality an intelligence cell .
it is not very often when wars are accompanied by democracy , or when wars lead to establishing democratic systems , or turning power over to the people instead of leaving it in the hands of the generals , officers , lieutenants and sergeants .
that is because there is some fundamental conflict between military culture and democratic culture .
the first is based on individualism , order , obedience , putting the regime and discipline ahead of anything else - even if it was wrong - following the golden rule that says : " implement first , then object , " even if it was by decapitation !
the second is based on consultation , dialogue and putting public interests ahead of individual interests , and it also respects the right to disagree and object and does not recognize any right not enacted by legislations , considering that the people are the source of authority , and that is why they grant legitimacy and hold accountable , directly or indirectly .
accountability in the democratic culture is the golden rule for guaranteeing " discipline " , or order , and the separation of powers in a way that prevents the domination of one power over the other or the influence of one person over an institution so that each power may check the other power without infighting , conspiring or collaborating to serve their interests at the expense of public interest , which is the interest of the people with all of their individuals , thus bringing down these powers in their eyes and losing the legitimacy they acquired .
no two people , provided they have minimum knowledge in economic matters , would disagree that lebanon will be faced with difficult financial dues that threaten it with bankruptcy in a short period unless a revival , which is now in the category of a miracle , occurs .
the optimists are talking about june 2005 as an inescapable due date , unless lebanon succeeds on the occasion of the presidential elections in renewing international confidence in her , which does not exist now after the paris commitments were lost in the presidents wars .
that confidence , which is also known to all those who work in the economy , currently pass through the partnership with the european union .
no matter how great french president jacque chirac 's friendship is with lebanon and no matter how distinguished his relations with president rafiq al-hariri ( assuming the latter stays in his position ) , there is no paris without a european concord .
this is what gives the situation that came up in brussels during the meeting of the council for cooperation and partnership with lebanon utmost importance .
of course , as soon as the european position made its way to beirut , everyone was roused against this flagrant interference in the internal affairs of lebanon , which is , by the way , has full sovereignty and independence against foreign interferences .
never mind , we have plenty of time for denunciation , but let us first hear the meaning of intervention .
the number of those who embarked on performing their " religious " duties with all humility before the majesty of the devil - the camera , was not small , including false witnesses , silent witnesses and traditional perpetrators , immediately following the conclusion of each of the two sessions witnessed by the al-najma court , which were known in advance to be of absolutely no value except for some additional humiliation of those who do not , would not and did not care .
as proof of that , their information kitchen distributed in a number of media outlets the " idea " of no winner and no loser after the first session .
it is an incorrect idea on two fronts :
the first front is that there is clearly a politically - overriding factor , which is those who control the cellular sector inside the lebanese power balance which is run by the syrian authority , a balance that includes , in the " economic " partnership , several sectors in which the number of beneficiaries , including lebanese and non lebanese , varies .
the second front is that there are the ethically disgraced in this case in particular who lost - ethically - to the disgracers and were never on equal footing with them in this regard .
in battle then , the disgracers have won politically .
was the pentagon hawk richard perle the " scapegoat " whose friend , member of the provisional governing council ahmad chalabi , had offered to be if the bush administration wanted one to seal the scandal of wrong intelligence on iraq before the war ?
or did he choose to resign from the defense policy board at the pentagon for his profitable projects and business to last in iraq ?
the reason that perle gave for his resignation , which was that he did not want his controversial views to influence the election campaign of president george bush , seems the least important .
ideologists like perle do not resign that easily from an influential position like this .
he had spent 17 years in it and was not shaken by linking his name , the least of which was last year , with more than one scandal .
even his stepping aside from the chairmanship of the board last year , remaining as a member , was not connected to these scandals .
to find out the reason , the iraqi aspect must be investigated where perle is engulfed in two issues : the first , profitable deals related to the reconstruction of iraq and before it to the war . investigations over them , which include the hollinger and boeing companies , have already started .
among the conclusions is that americans have never before witnessed a more difficult palestinian - israeli situation than the one existing now .
since not only there is the rightist and most radical governments in the history of israel , but there is also a hard - line israeli public opinion which assures a backdrop for the survival and continuity of this government , with one feeding on the other .
as far as the palestinians are concerned , americans contend that they are in their worst conditions since non - islamist civilians have no power to go into negotiations with sharon or to confront him .
this situation has in turn led to the conclusion that there is little , very little , that can be done in order to improve the situation on the ground .
the diplomats concerned with this information do not in principle disagree with the american conclusions in this regard , especially with the impossibility of achieving anything now or the frightening situation the palestinians are experiencing , but they contend that this situation is the logical result of israel 's relentless attempts since october 2000 to dismantle all of the elements of building the palestinian state .
the americans did not fail to push in that direction either by keeping silent on the practices of sharon , who took advantage of the united states war on terrorism to destroy all the foundations of what may constitute the palestinian entity or by striking the palestinian authority itself , represented by yasser arafat , and eliminating all possibilities for working with him , which made it easier for israel to isolate him and put all of the palestinian authority under the rock .
one of president elias al-hrawi 's anecdotes was that when he wanted to corner the contentious ministers at the council of ministers , whom he thinks may disagree with him on an issue he wants to discuss outside of the agenda , he would start his talk by putting the issue forward , " there is a proposal from minister abdullah al-amin , " who was a member in one of al-hrawi 's administration governments and was at the same time the regional secretary of the baath party in lebanon .
after presenting the issue , no matter what it may be , al-hrawi used to imply by whispering to the ministers who check with him that " the brothers are on board " and are not distant from this " proposal " , meaning of course " the syrian brothers , " which would guarantee the passing of the proposal , practically al-hrawi 's own proposal , without any objections or obstacles .
president al-hrawi told this anecdote at more than one occasion , and many remembered it during the past two days in the context of reading minister suleiman franjieh 's recent comments , which were serious and in which he violently attacked president rafiq al-hariri , accusing him of retracting from the " line " that he , al-hariri , was one of its pillars , but he implied that he was helpless in committing to the " arab patriotic national line " which expresses commitment to the alliance with syria .
a lot has been said about the comments by franjieh , who is known for his very special relations with the syrian leadership in depth and historical steadiness between the al-assad clan and the franjieh clan " father from grandfather " and which none of syria 's lebanese allies and friends has achieved .
one of the ironies in this relationship is that suleiman franjieh is one of the most succinct speakers when making comments , which are usually exaggerated , and for some they border on hypocrisy and pretentiousness to the point of almost losing their meaning .
based on this relationship , many read " a syrian message " into the part of franjieh 's comments dealing with al-hariri .
such a legitimate conclusion may seem pragmatic for a moment but at the same time seems " inaccurate . "
therefore , as long as we have freedom , we ought to enjoy it despite the obstacles .
it seems that this thinking is no longer theoretical to some groups among the population of this country , but it has been applied for a long time .
among the examples : the freedom of unaccountability , which makes the rulers immune from real inquiry .
the official makes mistakes and huge blunders of the kind that causes severe losses to the country and citizens .
but the freedom that he practices puts him in the position of being able to hypothesize integrity .
the freedom of no - explanation which equates between the one who is right and the one who is wrong , then the resounding slogans that are fit for the period from the dawn of history to the distant horizon in the future are launched .
we have lively examples in the recent discussions in the parliament , the iraqi oil discrepancies , the cotonou plane disaster and the citibank episode .
thanks to the freedom of no - explanation , everyone will feel comfort and safety , as there is no one accused , but rather there are accusations ; no wrongdoer with a certain identity , description , location , heritage and family roots , but there are wholesale mistakes .
the syrian president made sure in most , if not all , of his recent receptions to affirm three positions , apparently echoing his interest in emphasizing what syria is pondering at the present time :
the first is re - iterating his praise of the maronite patriarch mar nasrallah boutros sfir and his appreciation for his wisdom in handling the seriousness of the developments that face the region and his interest emanating from this position in everything that can instill comfort and satisfaction for christians .
the second is showing his support for president emile lahoud in stepping over his national and strategic options to affirming his confidence in the " state plan intention " which the president of the republic holds away from fanaticism and special interests .
this is what the syrian president heard from more than one visitor .
the third is al-assad 's displeasure with some of damascus ' allies for not appreciating the seriousness and sensitivity of this period , and their over indulgence in drowning the domestic situation in a political contest and getting distracted with such cases that do not , at the present time , tolerate such luxury or fervor for internal disputes , whether they have to do with the presidential entitlement or taking charge of the authority and its dossiers , including the cellular dossier recently .
i asked a minister friend for his opinion on the recent bishop council 's position regarding the presidential elections , and he answered me by stressing the significance of this old - new position , which unequivocally has dotted the i 's and crossed the t 's , either in terms of the specifications of the person of the president or in terms of the mechanism of his selection .
and he said that the situation has become very clear and shortcuts the very many interpretations and leaks over the presidential entitlement , which bkarki supports under the framework of respecting the laws and preserving the constitution .
i asked him then about the real reasons which led to president emile lahoud 's failure in implementing his reform plan and about those who obstructed such a plan as he claimed , but he shook his head without giving me an answer . i then asked him for the names of those who obstructed the implementation of this plan , and i did not receive any answer either .
i then said to him : does it make sense that you do not have any answer for what president lahoud stated with regards to the issue of reform and its obstruction ?
he shook his head again , only saying : " got it ! "
at this point i asked myself : is there anyone who can positively affirm that president lahoud has a reform plan ?
and who has seen it ?
it sounded absolutely hilarious when egyptian foreign minister ahmad maher and the secretary - general of the arab league , amr moussa , stood before reporters and kept struggling to keep " the well - protected secret " under wraps and to maintain the total blackout that surrounded the " joint arab action development " .
why all this intent on secrecy and obscurity ?
is it because the arab citizen and public opinion in the arab countries have no right to be informed of issues and ideas concerning the future of arab action , god forbid , or is it because these matters are only the concern of the regimes and the rulers , and people have no choice in the end but to wear whatever the heaven - sent leaderships have sewn ? !
it sounded hilarious because citizens in the arab countries had read what the " ap " agency reported on the saudi - egyptian reform initiative entitled : " a pledge and a declaration for the arab people , " and calls for more involvement by the arab peoples in managing their own political , economic , social and cultural affairs .
how could these people be involved in such critical and important matters when the " document " that the arab foreign ministers have agreed upon to develop joint arab action would become a well - protected secret , as we iterated , then it would be descended upon peoples ' heads after the convening of the arab summit in tunisia - if it were actually to be held ?
and why the skepticism about the feasibility of holding it ?
the late president rashid karami once chose to resign before the parliament at the opening of the session to deprive the opposition , which was threatening his government by withholding confidence from it , from scoring such a victory over him .
he said , addressing emile al-bustani , the opposition 's anti - government campaign leader at that time , as he was announcing his resignation , " i shall leave it as a burning desire in your heart by depriving you of the joy of bringing down the government by withholding confidence . "
the supporting representatives would not have blocked the session quorum unless the opposing representatives were in a position where they were capable of bringing down the government by withholding confidence from it to the extent that the opposing representatives were the ones , being a minority , who would resort to blocking the quorum to deprive it from a guaranteed majority confidence .
regarding his opinion on the existing dispute between the prime minister and the minister of communications over the cellular telephone , he said : had the people in charge of the government resorted to the constitutional institutions to settle their disputes , this would not have happened , not only on this issue , but on every other issue .
the disagreement between president al-hariri 's viewpoint and those who support it and minister qardahi 's viewpoint and those who support it must be settled at the council of ministers . either the ministerial majority would support the viewpoint of this person or that person so that the government could face the parliament united in opinion and stance on this subject .
the government must , on the other hand , defend its opinion in the parliament and explain its viewpoint and position on anything that is brought up ; either convincing the representatives , which would end the matter , or they remain unconvinced , in which case the parliamentary majority may then vote to settle the existing dispute , either in favor of the opponents or in favor of the government and its supporters . this would close the file and does not leave it open like it happened before with people not knowing where the truth is , whether in regards to the cellular telephone numbers or with regards to the terms of bidding and bargaining .
syria and the lebanese regime that emerged from the taif accord have held most of the christian political , party - affiliated and religious activists responsible for the very wide - scale christian boycott of the lebanese elections which were held in the year 1992 after two decades of extensions for the 1972 parliament as a result of the civil and non - civil wars that erupted in the country in the year 1975 .
at the time , they regarded the boycott as a way of going around the taif accord , especially by some sides who had supported it at the time , and without whose care and understanding , it would not have seen the light of day .
they also regarded it as a signal that some of the aforementioned people were interested in a truce to catch their breaths and regroup in preparation for fighting a final or decisive battle with the syrian military and political presence in lebanon when conditions are ripe for it .
at the time , syria punished the boycotters by deposing them from the first taif government , so to speak , but after re - assessing the internal lebanese situation and her interests in lebanon , and in consideration of it in the region , she gave the green light for the participation of some of those in the second government .
yet , the way some have conducted themselves despite their accepting involvement , the level of which was later lowered , hinted to damascus that nothing has changed in their strategic position toward syria and her regime in lebanon .
syria , of course , was unhappy about that , but she did not consider it to be " a disaster " because the christian representation in the taif governments and afterwards , as in the rest of the state institutions , was reasonable to a great extent .
on the one side , there is the most prominent christian northern leader suleiman franjieh .
and on the other side , there is the former " leader " of the " lebanese forces " elie hbeika .
the crisis - ridden official arab regime is like a car heading downhill at a high speed that accelerates with time with no brakes to help it stop the dash or even slow it down .
this is the official arab image that exhibits itself for us at the cairo meetings : confusion like no other from the overcrowding of external " initiatives " , which are closer to colonial dictations veiled with a modern speech and armed with a stack of " international reports . "
a strong feeling of helplessness and weakness toward the collapse of official arab immunity ( except in its intelligence and police sides which remain disobedient ! ) .
the defeat of saddam 's iraq followed by the occupation of the largest arab countries is a harsh message to the coup arabs and the military that the era of imaginary victories is over , meaning that full stomachs do not excuse people from despair , hopelessness and resorting to violence .
despite that , more and more stomachs that are getting empty used to be full in the past .
the era of wealth and boom , the so - called era of oil innocence , is over .
president amin al-gemayel 's assessment of the presidential elections differs from some of what was said about this entitlement in recent weeks because he envisions in it a real opportunity for syria , not to affect a change in lebanon alone but also to affirm her desire to expand the magnitude of this change so that she would become intended by it as well .
his viewpoint compels him to rule out any american role in the upcoming lebanese presidential elections for reasons some of which he attributes to that lebanon is no longer a direct american interest , some other to that american interest is focused at the present time on a new middle east dominated by reform and democracy in which lebanon is just a minor detail , and thirdly to the american - syrian relations which mandate that lebanon be a provision of .
nevertheless , the former president still adheres to his opposition for extending for president emile lahoud and does not hesitate to correct an old phalangist rule , in which he thinks that a deliberate distortion afflicted it lately , that the support of the phalanges party for the president of the republic , any president of the republic , has not once led to the support for renewing his term or extending it .
such was the state of the party with president bishara al-khouri when it was a partner in the campaign to bring him down in the year 1952 , then with president fouad chehab when it opposed his stay in power for a new term in the year 1964 .
that 's why he sees article 49 as one of the sources of the lebanese system 's strength because first it allows the handover of power in a manner not familiar to the arab regimes neighboring lebanon , which are immersed in their own dictatorships , and second , gives the opportunity for inquiry and holding accountable a president who realizes that his term is coming to an end and therefore , he does not get carried away .
following a spectacular popular , official and national memorial for martyred president rashid karami in tripoli , a meeting was held at the karami family palace with the participation of the majority of those who attended the dar al-fatwa meeting with syrian vice president abdel halim khaddam who seemed angry about the decision that was issued by the aforementioned meeting , speaking about a rush " and the blood of the martyr has not dried out yet . "
he then turned to al-hoss saying : " when you come to visit us in damascus , remind me to let you listen to a recording that will reveal to you how an attempt to assassinate you was being set up , so that you would know who those criminals are . "
a few days later , al-hoss visited damascus accompanied by al-husseini and they met with khaddam who said , upon being asked about the promised recording : " do you want to hear the matter from the mouth of elie hbeika ? "
al-hoss then replied : " i would rather hear from you . "
khaddam told the story of a meeting that included hbeika and two directors of a couple of security services in al-gemayel 's administration from among his top lieutenants at the home of a parliamentary bloc leader and a current representative who had visited al-hoss in 1990 especially to tell him that he had nothing to do with the explosion that targeted him .
al-hoss told the story complete with facts and names in his book " for the sake of truth and history " on pages 53 , 54 and 55 .
is it true that the united states is not interested in the presidential entitlement in lebanon or in who will be selected as president of the republic , contrary to her prior position ?
in fact , opinions differ in this regard .
a former foreign minister says that the united states is no longer interested in the presidential entitlement as in the past because the lebanese state started , after the taif accord , to gradually lose its role and the freedom of its decision , and this role has confused syria at various levels , not only at the political , defensive , security and external levels only , but at the domestic political affairs in their finest details and in the daily political life .
it is not within the lebanese state ability , for example , to enter into negotiations with israel without the prior consent of the syrian state , nor to sign a peace agreement unless syria signs such an agreement , nor to deploy the lebanese army along the borders with israel unless there 's an agreement with syria on that , nor to terminate the role of the lebanese resistance , and specifically " hezbollah " , even if israel withdraws from all of the lebanese territories she occupies , unless syria endorses that .
since the unity of the lebanese and syrian directions has subjected everything related to the issue to a coordination and an understanding between the two countries .
such unity translates into unity in direction and in destiny to the extent that the president of the lebanese republic has become a product of syria and not that of lebanon , and the formation of governments in lebanon takes place by a syrian intervention in order to remove the obstacles blocking their formation .
if this is the status of the lebanese state under the situation that has existed for more than twenty years , which is an odd situation , why then this interest in the state 's opinion if it did not have an opinion since opinions are reserved for the syrian state and discussions on every issue must be held with it ?
the talk about the situation of arab women , on international women 's day , is different this year , not because a change has occurred regarding the affirmation of their rights and protecting them but because these rights are becoming in the forefront of discussions on reform in the region , advocated not only by the west in general , but also echoed by many of the arab regimes , even if the matter too often seemed as a sudden discovery of half of the society .
but whether the debate about the situation of women and their rights is the result of external pressures or others , it does not matter because certain aspects of change have begun , and that does not mean in any case that the path is not very long and very complicated .
the voices arab women are beginning to rise , and on this occasion , a salute to all men and women who are meeting on women 's issues at the beirut summit and many other conferences in the arab world , and another salute to the sultanate of oman , which has chosen the occasion to appoint a woman , for the first time , to an important ministerial position , the ministry of higher education .
this movement and these aspects do not negate the fact that the most important way of abolishing discrimination against women is to legislate laws that guarantee their rights in all fields , from the home and family to the community and workplace in the private and public sectors .
this poses the problem of women 's representation in political life in the arab world , a shameful representation that is not excused by some exceptions , not in the one - party systems nor in those which pride themselves on a little democracy , such as lebanon .
in this regard , the provision related to women 's representation in the provisional iraqi constitution , which was signed yesterday , deserves a pause to contemplate its value .
