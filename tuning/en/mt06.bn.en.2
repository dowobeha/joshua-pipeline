welcome to al jazeera news .
a delegation of leaders of hamas , led by the head of the movement 's political bureau khaled meshaal , is holding talks in cairo with egyptian officials about the developments in the situation in the palestinian territory after the legislative elections , and consultation on the formation of the next palestinian government .
ismail haniya denied reports that either the egyptian government or the palestinian president asked the movement to recognize israel as a precondition to entrusting it to form the next palestinian government .
haniya said that although the movement is committed to its political agenda and the enduring principles of the palestinian people , it is also a practical and realistic movement .
haniya , one of the strongest candidates to head the first hamas government in palestine added that hamas might accept a long - term truce if israel releases the palestinian prisoners and ceases its assassination policy .
uh , there is no pressure being exerted by uh , our sister country egypt on the islamic resistance movement -- hamas -- for hamas 's political positions .
uh , the relationship between us and uh , egypt is a relationship based on mutual respect . on many occasions egypt hosted palestinian - palestinian discussions . we always , i mean , reached agreements and reconciled under egyptian patronage , but there is no pressure being exerted by egypt on hamas .
of course , hamas has its own political agenda which was its electoral program . while it will be faithful to the rights and unmovable principles of the palestinian people , it is at the same time a practical movement that deals with our arab and islamic milieu as well as the regional and international environment with an open mind . we will base our decisions and positions on protecting the higher interests of the palestinian people .
in the palestinian territory attorney general ahmed al-mughni said that the corruption investigations have revealed that top palestinian authority officials might have been involved in the theft or squandering of at least $ 700 million in public money .
at a press conference , al-mughni said that those involved in these cases will be prosecuted .
the file on the cement used to build the separation wall referred by the legislative council .
the file on middle east pipes referred by the legislative council . i will elaborate on this file .
we have submitted this file . there are about $ 6 million , of which $ 4 million is the palestinian authority 's share and $ 2 million is the share , uh , of the italian authority , the italian government .
this factory exists on paper and not in reality .
i am investigating how this money was wasted .
there are serious investigations on this issue .
there are also the files on embezzlement and abuse of affiliation -- affiliation and position -- fraud , and falsification of official documents by prominent people . there are more than 20 cases , some of which were filed as indictments in the courts having jurisdiction , and others are pending the completion of the investigations .
there is also a file on the forensic medicine institute in abu dayf , which is quite large . it is now under investigation by us .
there is also a file on the citizen 's protection association . there was a huge amount of embezzlement .
the file on the palestinian public television , radio and satellite agency shows that there was embezzlement of more than $ 20 million .
iran announced that it has suspended all %pw trade and economic ties with denmark in protest against ( ( the publication ) ) by one of its newspapers of drawings offensive to the muslims sentiments .
the european union warned iran that boycotting danish products would affect its commercial relations with the union countries .
meanwhile demonstrators today again stormed the danish embassy compound in tehran and threw molotov cocktails before evacuating it protesting against the publication of offensive drawings of the noble prophet .
[ ]
for the second consecutive day iranian demonstrators poured out their anger on the danish embassy . they burst into the embassy attacking it with incendiary bombs in protest against the publication by danish newspapers of drawings insulting to the prophet muhammad ibn abdullah ( god bless him ) .
the attack against the danish embassy was the second of its kind targeting a western embassy in tehran . yesterday about 200 student demonstrators threw stones at the austrian embassy shattering glass windows and setting small fires in it . the austrian mission was targeted because austria currently holds the presidency of the european union .
denmark protested to iran about the two attacks on its embassy and demanded that tehran protect its diplomats . meanwhile the european union stepped up its pressure on arab and islamic countries to control protests such as these . it reminded 19 countries that they are under treaty obligations to protect diplomatic missions .
thousands more muslims in all parts of the world participated in the protests condemning insulting the prophet of islam , some of which turned violent like what happened in the afghani capital , kabul , where police attacked the demonstrators with batons when they threw stones at the danish diplomatic mission , and arrested a number of them .
the kabul protest was preceded on monday by a protest outside bagram , the american military base in afghanistan . afghani forces fired at the demonstrators killing four and injuring at least 19 others .
the bagram protest is believed to be the first of its kind against an american target .
as the demonstrations spread across various parts of the islamic world , the administration of american president george bush appealed to the kingdom of saudi arabia to use its influence to help ease tensions in the middle east and europe .
denmark called upon its citizens in about 10 islamic countries to leave in the wake of the continuing angry demonstrations over the publishing of offensive drawings of the noble prophet in a danish newspaper .
the crisis between denmark and the muslim world escalated hindering denmark 's ability to contain it , despite the diplomatic call for that .
[ [ ns ] ]
in its worst nightmares denmark did not imagine the issue of the offensive cartoons of the noble prophet would have literally such fiery implications .
as expressed by the danish media , the scenes of the danish embassy and consulate in beirut and damascus in flames shocked them , and they were surprised by the amount of islamic anger in many parts of the world .
scenes that prompted danish foreign minister per stig moller to describe the situation as critical and acknowledge that the crisis had evolved beyond just denmark .
it is much more of a crisis than just with denmark . it threatens cooperation between the islamic and western worlds .
danish authorities thought that the apology by the newspaper jyllands - posten , which published the drawings , and the meeting by danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen with the ambassadors of islamic countries in copenhagen would be enough to calm the feelings of both the islamic public and officials , but apparently this was not enough .
while waiting for the outcome of the diplomatic appeal for help initiated by denmark at several levels to calm the situation , denmark came to the realization that its interests and economy will bear the cost of its silence over the hurt religious feelings of muslims on its territory .
danish companies could sustain losses of $ 1.6 billion if the store shelves in islamic countries remain empty of danish milk and cheeses .
however , there is more than just the economic boycott of danish products . the real shock might be the effect of the official american and british condemnations of the publication of the drawings .
condemnations that might undermine the huge efforts that denmark has made over the years to firmly set a distinctive policy of alliance with the united states , which has caused it to be described in europe as the " voice of america . "

the french magazine charlie hebdo republished the offensive cartoons of the noble prophet , saying that it had done so in support of the democratic right of freedom of expression .
in its editorial the magazine condemned what it described as an attempt by extremists to snatch away struggles concerned with democratic principles .
french president jacques chirac accused the newspapers which published these drawings of provocation which he said he believed would inflame feelings to a dangerous degree .
in indonesia the foreign minister said that the publication of the offensive drawings of the noble prophet provided an opportunity for extremist groups to allow the situation to get out of control . this statement coincides with what danish prime minister ( ( rasmussen ) ) stressed yesterday about the existence of elements who are pouring oil on the fire in the interest of their own agenda , in a direct reference to the presence of a political and religious function at those protest demonstrations .
[ ]
an excuse had to be found for all these protests sweeping the streets of the islamic world and for the amount of anger that has prevented listening to the western calls for calm .
a justification offered by danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen yesterday when he spoke about the existence of extremists pouring oil on the fire for the sake of what he called their personal agenda .
the indonesian foreign minister did not differ much when he announced today that the publication of the offensive drawings of the noble prophet provided an opportunity which the extremists used to allow the situation to get out of control .
[ ]
two statements were apparently drawn from indicators monitored by observers , including slogans used here in iran which targeted denmark as well as the united states , israel , and austria , which holds the presidency of the european union and hosts the headquarters of the international atomic energy agency .
the scene in iran was read as an attempt to exploit religious feelings and mobilize it against anyone who attempts to isolate iran on the basis of the record of its nuclear activities .
the same conspiracy theory was used to justify the depth of the demonstrations in syria and lebanon where some of its politicians rushed to accuse damascus of being behind it .
however , the spectacle of these demonstrations has more than one angle to it since it revealed , for example , that those characterized in the west as extremists were not always in the forefront of the demonstrators .
in gaza , activists from fatah and later islamic jihad were the main driving force behind the demonstrations .
in beirut , the sight of religious leaders trying to rein in the demonstrators was frequently repeated .
also in france , the position of the french islamic council seemed cautious compared to the position of organizations in the secular category .
regardless of the angle from which these demonstrations are viewed and the interpretations provided by each one of them , the anger of muslim youths over others hurting their deepest religious feelings remains the dominant fact of the whole picture .
in afghanistan at least four people were killed and 20 others injured today in zabul province in southern afghanistan in confrontations with the police during a demonstration condemning the offensive cartoons of the noble prophet .
an afghan security official said that the police fired into the air to disperse 600 demonstrators after they threw stones at the police , raising the number of dead in the demonstrations in afghanistan during the past week to 10.
in a press statement -- a copy of which was received by al jazeera -- united nations secretary general kofi anan , organization of the islamic conference head ekmeleddin oglu , and european union foreign policy chief javier solana expressed their great concern over the implications of publishing offensive drawings of the noble prophet and the angry reactions .
the statement added " we believe that freedom of the press demands responsibility and prudence , and must respect all religions . " it described the recent violent acts as exceeding the limits of peaceful protest .
the statement condemned the attacks on the diplomatic missions in damascus and beirut , and called upon the authorities to protect diplomatic facilities and foreign citizens .
united nations secretary general kofi annan has asked the american president george bush for american aid to send an international force to darfur . annan said that the protection of the displaced persons and ensuring the delivery of aid require cooperation from all governments .
american president george bush 's assessment of what he described as the united nations secretary general 's good leadership and his great optimism for the success of democracy and freedom in the world was received by kofi annan with a request for american aid to send an international force to darfur .
i am very happy that we have agreed to work together on the issue of darfur along with other governments in europe , asia , and other regions in order to guarantee an effective security presence on the ground to protect the refugees and to guarantee the delivery aid to those who need it . this , of course , is an issue with regard to which all governments must play their part .
a role which annan wants president bush to support is to assemble a force for the international organization to stop the acts of violence in the darfur region in western sudan . the proposed force -- as annan wants it -- must be readily capable of moving by air and on the ground with good communications equipment from europe and the united states to replace the african union force that is now protecting civilians in darfur .
despite the announcement by the united nations that the humanitarian situation has improved in the past year in the regions that have seen fighting since 2003 , hundreds of thousands of people still require relief , in spite of the tons of aid provided by the world food program . furthermore , the growth rate among children in darfur has dropped from about 4% to around 1.4% during 2005 , and the number of children with access to schools has increased three fold .
according to relief operations officials in the united nations , more than 14,000 humanitarian workers have provided aid for 3.5 million people , most of whom are displaced persons . they add that protecting civilians presents a great challenge .
officials in the united nations fear the instability in western darfur on the border with chad where at least 300,000 people have been unable to benefit from the humanitarian aid .
in the three years since the beginning of the crisis , the conflict in darfur has resulted in the death of about 300,000 people and the displacement of more than 2 million of the region 's inhabitants , turning them into refugees . no one knows if annan 's proposals are capable of solving it this time .
uh turkey is witnessing an early debate over the presidential elections to be held in april of next year .
the opposition believes that the current parliamentary makeup allows the ruling justice and development party to individually name the next president to be elected prior to the parliamentary elections according to the constitution .
meanwhile the government is refusing calls by the opposition for early parliamentary elections that precede the choosing of the president .
the comfortable majority that the ruling justice and development party enjoys in the parliament makes it capable of electing a new president after the term of president ahmet necdet sezer expires in the spring of next year .
according to the turkish constitution , the parliament nominates and elects the president .
this reality worries the opposition which does n't wish to see an islamist sitting in the presidential palace . it has called for holding early elections on the pretext that the current parliamentary makeup does not represent the people 's opinion .
in the last elections , the ruling justice and development party won 34% of the votes but it constitutes 66% of the seats due to the parliamentary threshold law . that means that it is able to choose whoever it wants as president without taking into consideration the 65% of the public who did not vote for the justice and development party , which is not fair .
the ruling justice and development party refuses to seek a verdict in early elections whose results could alter the current parliamentary makeup , and it insists that it will choose the country 's new president .
we have absolutely no intention of holding early parliamentary elections prior to choosing the president . the constitution gives us this right and we will not waive it .
the turkish president does not enjoy great executive powers . but he heads the national security council and appoints bureaucratic leaders in the state 's educational , judiciary , and other institutions . these are powers that the justice and development party needs to carry out its program of reform in turkey .
furthermore , the islamic public in turkey would not forgive the justice and development party for letting this opportunity slip by . opinion polls indicate that the party 's base has among its priorities electing one of its own as an islamic president to sit in the presidential palace , which would be a moral victory over the ataturkian secular forces in turkey .
the aspiration to elect an islamic president in turkey means that the hopes and dreams of the islamic political movement in turkey have not yet come to an end , and that the influence and positions obtained by the justice and development party are only one step on a long road .

five people were killed and dozens were injured during demonstrations targeting western interests in protest against denmark 's failure to apologize for the offensive drawings .
indonesian importers decided to boycott danish products in protest against those drawings .
despite attempts by the european union to calm the feelings of muslims , western politicians are escalating the situation with their statements and their positions .
in protest against the offensive drawings pakistani demonstrators drew this picture of the city of peshawar .
dozens were killed and injured after the police and the special guard intervened .
they did not discriminate between norwegian , american , and korean commercial and service offices .
they are protesting against the offensive drawings and they are demanding an official danish apology .
in pakistan they wanted another protest to be peaceful and artistic .
a donkey race with each donkey carrying a picture of a western leader .
in the philippines , where islam was introduced by arab traders , protests continued . in spite of the sight of their mostly western clothing , the protest against the offensive drawings was very strong .
they tried to be creative in insulting danish symbols . burning alone was not enough . they made flags in order to enthusiastically tear them up later .
we muslims are ready to fight anyone who mocks our prophet ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) .
fighting .
a fight is what the european union does not want .
javier solana visited arab countries where he made public statements about respect for islam .
but continued re - publication , and the emergence of new western positions are frustrating solana 's task . some european members of parliament object even to peaceful protests .
in other words , a boycott of danish products is considered a boycott of european union products .
an italian minister was quoted as saying that he intends on wearing shirts with the offensive drawings . he considers them a conversation piece .
the artist 's dialogue with the west already began on a new iranian website which has drawings mocking the holocaust .
the danish newspaper jyllands - posten will not publish the winning drawings .
the danish government will be put to a difficult test if the newspaper later decides to publish the holocaust drawings because the government of denmark has said that democratic governments do not interfere with what newspapers publish .
although sweden , denmark 's neighbor , officially intervened and closed a website that intended to publish the drawings , and western politicians objected to the re - publication .
positions that apparently were motivated by fear of one 's interests and human life , because it emerged after the peaceful or violent demonstrations and the boycott campaigns .
hundreds of additional pictures of the torture at abu ghraib prison were posted on a website following those broadcast by an australian television .
but the u.s. department of defense said that there was no need to further incite an uproar over what it described as old pictures .
the scandal coincides with a united nations proposal for the closure of another notorious american prison , guantanamo , which was rejected by the bush administration .
the american administration has defended , is defending , and will continue to defend the guantanamo detention camp despite the strong criticism .
a united nations legal report demanded the immediate closure of the detention camp .
they basically considered questions such as whether they were detained arbitrarily or legally . they concluded that they were being detained there illegally .
they must be charged and given the opportunity to defend themselves .
i believe that it will be necessary to close guantanamo sooner or later .
the official u.s. response is expected to be " no " to the closing of the prison camp . the detainees are treated humanely . moreover , it rebukes the u.n. team .
the u.n. team was granted permits to visit the guantanamo detention camp , but its members refused to go there .
the red cross visits the detainees freely .
what mcclellan chose not to clarify is that the red cross publishes its reports for the detention authority only . therefore the red cross did not reveal any scandal related to the treatment of detainees in guantanamo .
the united nations team for its part refused to visit guantanamo because its members were not permitted to meet privately with the detainees .
human rights organizations are worried about american attempts to redefine torture , and the fact that the prosecutors , judges , lawyers , and possibly the executioners later on are american soldiers .
even the european parliament unanimously demanded that international law be applied to the guantanamo detainees .
in the name of humanity this detention camp must be closed down . they should be given a fair trial or released if they are not proven guilty of anything .
the united nations report was released shortly after the publication of the pictures of iraqi youths in a british military center in basra , coinciding with new pictures of earlier torture in abu ghraib .
but the u.s. secretary of defense does not see the need to raise an outcry .
these images do not offer anything more than what we saw the first time , and those who engaged in that behavior were punished .
when you torture or beat up people with such cruelty you are no different from dictatorial regimes .
probably the greater embarrassment in the issues of guantanamo and abu ghraib theoretically is that of the arab governments who abandoned their citizens .
the iraqi government actually condemned what goes on in abu ghraib and demanded that the prison be handed over so that it could manage it itself .
but its record in jadiriya and the news of the death squads would make it difficult for the detainees to choose between an american warden and a non - american warden .
the talk about the presence of al qaeda groups in lebanon is linked to the arrest by lebanese security forces of a number of people who believe in this movement and established groups in the country . investigations have revealed that some of them were preparing military actions .
but the most important part of this is the information that continues to circulate linking a group arrested in beirut to the assassination of the martyred president rafik hariri .
investigations of members of two salafist groups presumably affiliated with al qaeda are continuing ( ( %pw ) ) . they are currently under arrest by the security forces and the lebanese judiciary .
the first group consists of five people , four lebanese and a syrian known as abu qatada . they were arrested in the northern town of ( ( brayeh ) ) . information indicates that they were in iraq and were detained for about six months by the american forces . one of them had both his legs amputated after a mine explosion .
the second group was arrested in beirut and consists of 13 people of various arab nationalities . they had in their possession weapons and forged citizenship documents and they address each other using pseudonyms .
according to security sources they are :
1. the leader of the group , hasan muhammad nabaa , who participated in the events of ( ( al-dinniyah ) ) in 2000 and fled to syria . he joined his brother in sunday 's demonstration .
2. amir abdallah hallaq , a palestinian mechanical engineer .
3. hani hashim al-shanti , a naturalized computer engineer of palestinian origin .
4. hamad turki ( ( al-rabei ) ) , a syrian .
5. muhammad abd al-razzaq wafai , a syrian .
6. faysal asaad akbar , a saudi citizen . he entered lebanon with a forged passport under the name fahd muhammad al-khadim al-yamani . he fought side by side with al qaeda in afghanistan and then moved to syria .
7. muhammad ahmad kujah , a syrian .
8. tariq al-nasir , a syrian neurosurgeon . he accompanied some of these elements to iraq .
9. ali jihad sharaf al-din , a lebanese minor . he was responsible for transporting explosives .
10. khidr muhammad naba , a lebanese .
11 . malik muhammad nabaa . he was responsible for collecting explosive bags and devices .
12 . bara ' muhammad fuad , a syrian .
13 . muadh abd al-ghani shushah , a syrian .
information indicates that all of them are in contact with a syrian from homs known as jamil , who is an expert in electrical engineering , explosives , and booby traps . he provided money and weapons to fighters heading for iraq . this information also revealed that the two most dangerous members of this group , khalid taha and bilal zaarura , entered lebanon from syria last december and are presumed to be in the ayn al-hilwah camp . they were never arrested .
from the interrogation of the members of this group much information has been weaved together about its involvement in the assassination of president rafik hariri . the international investigations committee and the americans have asked to see this information which might have been seen by a high level judicial authority .
the members of this group are still being held by the information branch of the internal security forces who accompany them to the military investigating magistrate to continue interrogating them about the charge of attempting to carry out terrorist operations .
however , the way this issue is being handled suggests that there is internal information related to the assassination . but the judicial sources do not confirm this information because they do n't have any material evidence and refer to it as political talk aimed at moving the accusations from one place to another .
good evening .
hezbollah , which %pw refrained from participating in sunday 's demonstration , benefited from the spectacle of riot and disorder by presenting today a contrary image through an organized and disciplined rally of hundreds of thousands of people .
in addition to the point of organization and discipline , the secretary general of hezbollah , hassan nasrallah , supported by the impetus of a meeting with general aoun in mar mikhail , rushed to politically attack those whom he called the current authority caretakers , calling upon them to turn over the facts produced by the recent developments , accusing some of those managing the country of contributing to the intensification of political and sectarian tensions .
nasrallah , who is feeling renewed political comfort , is ready with a prioritized agenda for the next phase . the most important thing is a call to those who want to go to war with syria or against syria to take advantage of their party , group , or community . but , according to nasrallah , they should not drag the government , the state , or its institutions into a war of this kind .
on the other hand , hours after hezbollah 's political and public protest , prime minister fouad siniora attempted to monitor the disastrous consequences of last sunday by hosting a spiritual summit conference that is being held right now in the grand palace .
for more details we have this live report from our colleague denise rahmy fakhry .
good evening denise .
good evening george .
yes , at this time the summit has not yet begun , but it will begin , i mean , in a few moments . we are waiting for the arrival of all the personalities and sectarian leaders who are participating in this summit conference at the grand palace hosted by the prime minister %pw , excuse me , prime minister fouad siniora .
so , uh , some of , uh , the sectarian leaders participating are : maronite patriarch cardinal mar nasrallah boutros sfeir ; the mufti of the republic of lebanon , muhammad rashid qabbani ; the vice president of the higher shiite islamic council sheikh abd all - majid qablan ; patriarch gregorius iii lahham , roman catholic patriarch of antioch and the rest of the east , including alexandria and jerusalem .
also participating were armenian catholic patriarch nerses bedros xix and dr. salim sahyouni , president of the supreme council of the evangelical community in syria and lebanon .
also participating were archbishop elias awdeh , archbishop boulos mattar , archbishop kegham khatcherian , as well as archbishop roland abu jawdeh .
representing the druze sect judge nihad hreiz is participating . also participating are : archbishop narsai baz , archbishop %pw mar athanasius afram barsoum -- i apologize if i am mispronouncing the name ; archbishop michel qasarji , archbishop boulos tehdah , monsieur george al-masri , archbishop andre haddad , and pastor uh bishawi , the leader of the holy sect in lebanon and syria .
so these are the names of those participating in this spiritual meeting or as george described it , the spiritual summit .
we also learned that during this summit conference %pw prime minister fouad siniora will deliver an important speech . he refused to reveal its contents prior to reading it to the attendees .
we have also learned that following the meeting prime minister siniora will host an evening banquet in honor of all the sectarian leaders participating today in this meeting at the grand palace .
george .
mar maroun church in gemayzeh , which was subject to riots last sunday , today celebrated saint maroun 's day in an official mass celebration which brought together lebanese factions , foremost among them president emile lahoud , prime minister fouad siniora , and a representative of president berri .
this year 's mar maroun day celebration comes at a time when lebanon is going through difficult circumstances .
the holiday brought together all the spiritual families of lebanon at mar maroun church in gemayzeh .
among the attendees was president general emile lahoud , prime minister fouad siniora , and member of parliament abd al-latif al-zayn , representing the speaker of the parliament .
a large number of ministers , members of parliament , political , trade union , social , media , and spiritual figures also participated in the divine sacrifice , as well as ambassadors of major foreign countries .
the sacrifice was led by archbishop boulos matar who stressed that the tradition of gathering in the mar maroun church in beirut for prayers goes back three quarters of a century , and that its continuance is only an indication of the love that binds the lebanese despite their differences .
what is needed today is love and not mistrust and hostility that do not build anything .
the security we lacked in our capital for hours , and the sense people got that they were without a roof to protect them , their livelihood , and their sacred things makes us strongly question what we have been trying to prove for the past 30 years during which we almost lost everything and we shed a huge amount of blood and tears in the hope that we as well as our generations would witness a bright tomorrow in a secure , stable , and completely sovereign homeland , and a just and strong state .
is it reasonable for us to wait longer ?
archbishop matar stressed the need for ongoing dialogue through consultation with people and multiple opinions to find the best solutions for the majority of the citizens .
but the majority should not gather people on the basis of their religious or other affiliations , but rather on the basis of their opinions .
it should move with the transfer of power from one side to another without embarrassment to anyone .
the game of free minds , hearts , and wills increases in value when the group 's enlightenment , rationality , and practice of its freedoms increase .
that is without doubt the soundest basis for determining what is good for the group because everyone participates in the search and the decision making .
it also ordains that the majority -- any majority -- must take into consideration the opinion of the minority and unification rather than antagonism .
on this occasion prayers were held for establishing love and peace all over lebanon .
in ( ( bkirki ) ) maronite patriarch cardinal sfeir stressed in his holiday sermon how much solidarity is needed during these cruel times in lebanon .
we celebrate today the holiday of saint maroun , the father of our maronite church . the best way to celebrate saints is to emulate the way they lived their lives .
the words of the maronite patriarch , cardinal mar nasrallah sfeir .
while leading the celebratory mass at the church of the patriarchal palace on the occasion of the celebration of the holiday of mar maroun , there was an opportunity to call attention to saint maroun 's life , which was marked by giving , prayer , asceticism , and fighting the temptations and vanities of the world .
cardinal sfeir called upon the lebanese to unite in these cruel times .
we express our deepest sorrow over the vandalism , destruction , and violations during last sunday 's events in the capital beirut which were intended to ignite discord . thank god the citizens knew how to protect themselves from greed .
we congratulate our maronite brothers and sons on this holiday , here and in the nearby and distant diaspora , and we call upon all of them to emulate the virtues of this saint , especially his traits of fear of god , renunciation of earthly vanities , and love of people .
he seemed to say that in the presence of god we are worthless slaves , amen .
after the celebratory mass on the holiday of mar maroun , the congregation and well - wishers moved to the patriarchal palace , where cardinal sfeir received the representative of the french ambassador , francois abi saad
the secretary of a delegation of maronite clerical graduates in ghadir spoke as well .
the circumstances are extremely difficult . what this nation needs is obvious , but there are some who do n't want its citizens to have comfort .
but we have to close ranks with each other and realize that in unity there is strength while in division there is weakness .
israel strongly rejected the invitation by russian president vladimir putin to the leaders of hamas to visit moscow to discuss the peace process in the middle east .
for its part washington expressed caution over the russian step and repeated its opinion that hamas is a terrorist organization , while france viewed putin 's initiative as a possible support for the position of the quartet .
the international attempts to cordon off hamas after its victory in the palestinian legislative elections , were violated by russia in an attention grabbing position . from madrid , russian president vladimir putin promised to invite hamas leaders to moscow soon to discuss the future of the peace process between the palestinians and the israelis .
we never perceived hamas as a terrorist organization .
we have to acknowledge that hamas came to power in the palestinian territory through legitimate and democratic elections .
we have to respect the decision of the palestinian people by finding solutions acceptable to all palestinian factions .
meanwhile an official in the russian foreign ministry stated that moscow will ask hamas to change its hard - line policies , including the recognition of israel . the russian proposal was immediately welcomed by hamas .
we are eager to maintain relations with %pw all countries in the regional and international family . furthermore , it would be our pleasure to visit russia and i mean consult and discuss with the government and the %pw russian president .
tel aviv strongly rejected putin 's step , and expressed the opinion that it was a real stab in israel 's back .
the israeli minister of education , meir sheetrit expressed his belief that the goal of the initiative was to grant international legitimacy to a terrorist group , as he put it .
russia has to withdraw from any middle east peace negotiations . i suggest that president putin reverse his decision to invite members of terrorist organizations involved in murder .
the israeli position coincides with the position of washington , which expressed caution over the russian initiative .
they must recognize israel , renounce terrorism , and comply with the international agreements signed by the palestinian authority . as a member of the quartet , we expect russia to send the message .
for his part , assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs david welch pointed out that his country would reexamine its assistance to the palestinians if hamas forms the new government .
welch expressed his belief that it would not be sufficient for hamas to agree to a long - term truce with the hebrew state .
the chairman of the executive committee of the lebanese forces , dr. samir geagea , stressed that the forces will also tackle peace with the same ferocity that it tackled war .
%pw geagea declared in front of ( ( party members ) ) of the lebanese forces in the aley region that work would continue to find a candidate who is acceptable to all to succeed the late member of parliament edmond ( ( naim ) ) .
dr. samir geagea stressed that the consultation and search for a candidate acceptable to all would continue , to avoid an electoral battle in baabda aley .
( ( the words ) ) of the chairman of the lebanese forces executive committee was during a meeting with forces cadres in the aley area within the framework of regular preparatory meetings for restructuring the lebanese forces party .
at present we are pursuing a very serious attempt to find a candidate to avoid an electoral battle , despite the fact that it is a democratic battle , and to find a candidate agreeable to all parties .
now , a candidate satisfactory to all concerned parties ( ( has reached you ) ) . of course we respect all concerned parties , particularly the free patriotic movement . a candidate acceptable to all requires us to discuss behind closed doors all of the names , proposed and not proposed .
proposed and not proposed until we both find a name acceptable to both sides .
this for us will constitute agreement . we will sit down together and suggest one or two names , or three , or five , or ten . we might possibly reach ( ( as many as ) ) 15 or 20 names until we find a name among them that is satisfactory to us as well as the rest of the parties concerned with the battle .
this is what we are trying to do right now putting all our weight into it and decisively focusing on it . we are trying to find him .
i simply and honestly wanted to keep you updated , but at the same time i want to tell you again that this does not mean that you should n't participate in the parliamentary elections if this endeavor does not result in the desired outcome .
dr. geagea also touched on two key issues currently debated on the political front . they are the issue of the economic situation and the need to find a real solution that can be implemented . the second issue is the policy of patience and the self restraint that the lebanese forces is calling for in the wake of the recent events .
today we have courageously entered the war . and we want to tackle peace with same courage that we entered the war . peace requires much greater courage than war .
it is not a matter of manhood the way we know it . at times self restraint and calm require much more courage than pulling the trigger and shooting .
( ( anyone can shoot ) ) , but not everyone can restrain himself ( ( from shooting ) ) . some are criticizing us for ignoring the social and economic conditions and pursuing politics .
the answer to that is , it is impossible to think about any serious economic or social solutions outside the realm of the establishment of an actual strong state .
you ca n't just think of a solution . you can gather all the world 's experts to give all imaginable solutions , but these solutions need someone to implement them . who is going to implement them ? they need an actual state to implement them . we still do not have this actual state .
it should be noted that the chairman of the lebanese forces executive committee met at his headquarters in al-arz with british ambassador james watt for an hour . the british ambassador did not make any statement .
uh , before we continue bringing you the news i want to apologize for an error at the beginning of the report concerning the position of dr. samir geagea , who stressed that the forces will tackle peace with same courage that it entered the war . that mistake was due to a printing error .
[ [ ns ] ]
the leader of the executive board of the lebanese forces , dr. samir geagea , spoke about what he called a rescue plan to liberate the presidency of the republic on the naharkum saiid show .
it 's a multifaceted plan because ( ( the way i see it ) ) the situation in the country will continue uh in the alternating state it is in .
of course , the presidency is a vital position , contrary to ( ( what a large number of people believe ) ) . based on this , if we are to hope for any improvement in the conditions in the country , we have to start specifically from this position .
now , of course , the elements of this plan are still under study but its key elements will be constitutional , legal , political , and public .
um .
okay . what is the plan 's timeline ? i mean , is there a specific timeline for this matter ?
not much .
not much . of course , uh , this kind of a move , this kind of a plan , i mean , no one can estimate exactly when it will be completed , but we can estimate when we will start .
um .
um .
okay , general michel aoun yesterday expressed his opinion that the term extension of president lahoud was coerced , as was the electoral law . do you agree with this comparison ?
no , and this -- i mean this is an inaccurate and unscientific comparison .
the extension for president lahoud was coerced in the sense that the intelligence service ( ( picked up the representatives ) ) , threatened them , and told them , " you have to sign the extension law . " while the electoral law of 2000 was proposed in the parliament another law , the law of 60 , was proposed , and after negotiations they reached a political settlement .
once again i repeat the intelligence service did not pick up representatives and tell them " you must sign the 2000 law . " no. there was a political settlement based on everybody 's ( ( need ) ) to hold the elections on time . okay . ( ( the country will have a constitutional void ) ) .
based on uh president berri using his post to pass the 2000 law because it was ( ( how ) ) ? it was the most appropriate law so the parties were compelled to reach a political settlement . of course the political settlement is one thing , and coerced extension -- in other words %pw -- because force and compulsion are something completely different .
so the 2000 law that we of course do not agree to was passed based on a %pw political settlement reached at the time based on the prevailing circumstances .
representative boutros harb expressed the opinion that resolution 1559 put the president in an illegal position , and he found the call by general michel aoun for early elections odd .
> representative boutros harb says that the christmas message he sent ( ( ) ) to the president of the republic , general emile lahoud , was interpreted by president lahoud as support for him . when he did not take a decision to step down the march 14th forces had to look seriously into the issue of the presidency .
uh , of course we hope that the president realizes the seriousness of the situation and its very negative consequences on the lebanese front if he stays where he is . %pw he is inflicting great harm to the presidency , to say nothing of the harm he is suffering personally . i mean , the president , because any debate , any debate we watch on the television is %pw , is %pw , is in fact using offensive and insulting language . furthermore , the position of the presidency has become absent %pw , absent , i mean , it does not exist in the political life except for statements that respond to someone or someone else . of course this is further hurting the presidency uh , as well as his negative positions in rejecting laws passed by the parliament regardless of whether he has the right to do so or not .
harb pointed out several means to address the issue of the presidency . there are both constitutional and legal aspects , and there is political and public action .
( ( sheikh ) ) , can you tell us which constitutional and legal mechanism you are relying on ? will you rely on the text of 1559 , the ( ( larsen ) ) and ( ( mehlis ) ) reports ? what will you rely on , i mean , to remove the president ?
1556 provided for the necessity of holding free presidential elections respecting the constitutional provisions .
what happened during the elections is that the next day a decision was issued that totally contradicted %pw %pw , one of the articles of this resolution . this means that internationally the presence of the president of the republic is in violation of 1556 , and contradicts the international trend and international legitimacy . this of course is a very big opening that can be dealt with politically in a way that would result in placing the president of the republic in an illegitimate position in relation to the international community . therefore , it will be dealt with on this basis . but this has so far not happened . in fact , we do n't want that to happen because we think that we will reach this attempt . therefore , we want the president of the republic to take the initiative , because the fact is that he is not begrudged , i mean .
( ( sheikh ) ) but %pw general aoun , i mean the one who opposed the extension and opposed the president of the republic is now opposed to removing the president , and instead of calling for presidential elections is calling for early parliamentary elections . how do you respond to this statement ?
%pw what is the goal of the elections ?
that we restore %pw
i mean the outcome might be different than the current political structure . %pw so - and - so might gain more while someone else might lose . this is not what we need .
we need to benefit from the international support for ( ( lebanon ) ) and the existing national circumstances that became clear yesterday , february 14th . this , this national intermarriage is happening for the first time in lebanon 's history ( ( for females who were born ) ) in lebanon first ( ( for females who were born ) ) in lebanon , one free independent sovereign , i mean , the history of lebanon is witnessing a new way of operating and it would be a shame to let it pass by ( ( ) ) .
the country is not short of men .
none of us can claim that he is the only suitable person and all the others are not suitable .
there are many good people in lebanon and there are people who consent to us negotiating on their behalf .
what we are concerned with are lebanon 's interests , that no one of us should negotiate lebanon 's security . we all have to forgo our personal demands and forgo our affiliations . on the contrary , let us make every effort to agree on someone who supports our common project for building a modern state and establishing sovereignty and independence , and reasserting the authority of the state over all of lebanon . this is the project that we must pursue . let us not pursue individual projects .
regarding the presidency , harb believes that the individual is not important , but rather the project and the history of the individual , as well as his aspirations and his ability to interact positively with all the forces .
