rabat 12-16 ( afp ) - the moroccan justice minister , mr. mohamed bouzoubaa , rejected today , thursday , that terrorist acts in holland be linked to morocco because those accused of carrying out such acts hold dual dutch and moroccan nationality .
dutch authorities detained mohammed bouyeri , 26 , with dual moroccan and dutch nationality , under suspicion of involvement in the assassination of the dutch movie director theo van gogh on the second of november along with six other suspects .
in an interview with the " aujourd'hui le maroc " newspaper , bouzoubaa stressed that the persons involved in terrorism cases in holland " do not only hold dual moroccan and dutch nationality but some of them were born in holland . "
the minister added , " this is what drives me to scrutinize the claim of any moroccan dimension to the terrorist acts committed in holland . "
bouzoubaa said that in spain " some moroccan detainees are clearly suspects in taking part directly or indirectly in the preparation for the events of may sixteenth , " in reference to the attacks of may , 16th , 2003 that resulted in the killing of 45 persons , including 12 suicide bombers , in casablanca .
he confirmed " that the moroccan terrorists also established relations with foreign egyptian and afghani networks " and " that there was in fact a relation to the al-qaeda network . "
rabat " vehemently " rejected on the tenth of november the statements of the dutch european commissioner for the internal market , fritz bolkestein , who asked the moroccan monarch , king mohammed vi , to condemn islamic extremism and to confirm that his country " does not want to export killers . "
the then minister delegate for foreign affairs , tayeb fassi fihri , stated that those statements were considered " unacceptable verdicts about the alleged responsibility of morocco " for the assassination of the dutch movie director .

nairobi 1-9 ( afp ) - sudan 's vice president ali uthman taha and the chairman of the sudan people 's liberation army , the southern rebellion movement , signed today , sunday , the final peace agreement in southern sudan according to journalists of the agence french presse .
taha and garang signed the agreement in the presence of a number of african presidents and prime ministers and a number of representatives of the international community among them the american secretary of state colin powell .
the ceremony took place in " nyayo , " one of nairobi 's two large stadiums near the center of the city .
the kenyan president mwai kibaki and the ugandan president yoweri museveni signed as " witnesses " on the agreement according to the official ceremony protocol .
museveni is the president of the intergovernmental authority on development ( igad ) , a consortium of seven countries that had mediated this peace process .
powell also signed the agreement along with other witnesses , among them the norwegian minister of international development hilde johnson .
this agreement brings to an end a 21 - year civil war , the longest ongoing conflict in the african continent .

the conflict resulted in the killing of at least 5.1 million people and the displacement of about four million people .

however , peace in the south gives a significant push to the progress of negotiations between the government and the rebel movements in darfur .

european commission opens discussions on european economic immigration policy
strasbourg 1-11 ( afp ) - the european commission launched today , tuesday , a consultative operation about the feasibility of implementing a new policy for economic immigration to the european union aimed at covering the shortage in workforce that is expected as a result of the aging of the european society .
those consultations will take place through " a green book " in which all member countries , social partners and non - governmental organizations will write their suggestions and visions before april 15 so that the commission can recommend a work plan before the end of the year .
the commission confirmed that " if immigration continues at the current rate , between 2010 and 2030 the decrease in workforce in the 25 union countries would lead to the number of workers dropping by 20 million . "
it added that " a higher immigration ratio may become even more important to cover the needs of the european market . "
the commission , however , stressed that these measures would never limit the number of workers allowed to enter each country because that was under the jurisdiction of national administrations according to the european constitution project .
but the commission said that the decision to allow foreigners to enter a country of the union would impact the other union countries because of the freedom of movement inside the " schengen " area and because of the right to use the services of the other countries , etc ...
the commission recommended setting uniform standards for allowing immigration with the highest level possible of harmony and agreement according to the will of the member countries .
the european union commissioner responsible for justice , freedom and security franco fratini recognizes " that the member countries , the european parliament , the labor unions , the companies and other relevant entities all have their different views on this issue . "
if italy and spain support opening the door to more immigration , germany will suffer from a high unemployment rate , a matter it opposes .
the european commission had presented a recommendation to unify the european union entry and residency requirements for this kind of legal immigrants but it had failed .

sharp controversy in morocco over media reports on king 's income
rabat 1-14 ( afp ) - a sharp controversy is simmering in morocco over the freedom of the press when it comes to issues related to king mohammed vi himself , after publishing articles criticizing the income and activities of the moroccan monarch .
the independent newspaper " aujourd'hui le maroc " wrote in its front page " the royal establishment is a new target for the nihilists " pointing out that hurting the person of the king in some papers " harms the democratization process . "
this accusation , which was repeated in several op - ed pieces and by many political officials , is aimed at two independent weekly newspapers , " tel quel " and " le journal hebdomadaire " that are waging " a systematic campaign " against the king .
" tel quel " published under the headline " the king 's salary " a detailed file about the king 's revenues and the expenses of al-makhzin ( the royal palace ) and the other palaces paid by the moroccan people , which amount to 210 million euros every year .
the weekly " le journal hebdomadaire " published on its front page an empty picture of the throne with a caption " what is the king doing ? "
along with criticism about the absence of the king from official events including the funeral of yasser arafat in cairo last november 12 .
in his turn , the leader of the national popular movement ( center right ) mahjoubi aherdane denounced in " aujourd'hui le maroc " " the conspiracy led by those who have plotted against al-makhzin in the past " in reference to the two coup attempts against the late hassan ii in 1971 and 1972 .
the editor - in - chief of the weekly " la tribune " ( independent ) attacked the two targeted newspapers and those in charge of them and accused them of committing " scandalous and deceiving violations . "
the arabic language weekly " asdaa " ( independent ) also denounced " the real conspiracy being plotted against morocco , which aims at hitting the royal establishment that guarantees the country 's strength and unity . "
no comment or official objection has been issued by the palace or the government for the articles that seem to have crossed the traditional " red lines " of moroccan journalism .

madrid 1-14 ( afp ) - amnesty international announced today , friday , that it had brought its " concern " over the human rights situation in morocco to the attention of the spanish monarch as he would be conducting a state visit to morocco between the 17 and 19 of january .

the organization expressed its concern over " the increase of acts of torture against alleged islamists in custody in morocco since 2002 . "
the statement showed that the new antiterrorism law approved after the casablanca attacks ( 45 killed on may 16 , 2003 ) allows torture by extending the detention of those suspected of terrorism to 12 days without the help of a lawyer .
in its statement , the organization called for the release of 412 moroccan prisoners of war detained in the prisons of the polisario front in the west sahara , which calls for the independence of this former spanish colony annexed by morocco in 1975 .
on the other hand , the organization lauded the new family law approved in 2004 , which raises the legal marriage age for women from 15 to 18 and imposes strict conditions on polygamy .

iran denies information about presence of american commandos in iran
tehran 1-19 ( afp ) - a senior iranian official has dismissed media reports that groups of american commandos have infiltrated into iran to identify location of nuclear sites for possible air strikes , as iranian press reported today , wednesday .
" american commando groups can not enter iran so easily to spy . it is naive to accept such an idea , " said ali agha mohammadi , a spokesperson for the supreme national security council .
" we know our borders , " he added .
mohammadi criticized reports in the american magazine " the new yorker " dismissing them as part of the " psychological campaign " against the islamic republic .
the " new yorker " wrote in its latest issue that american commando groups had been carrying out surveillance missions in iran since the summer of 2004 to seek out potential nuclear and chemical targets .
in spite of the denial by the american department of defense ( the pentagon ) , publishing this information has raised predictions of potential american military operations to stop iran 's nuclear activities .
the intensity of those predictions increased when the american president george bush said monday in an interview with the " nbc " american television network that he did not rule out a military operation against iran .
bush said , " i hope that we can solve this problem in a diplomatic way , but i will not rule out any option . "
ali agha mohammadi said that the new yorker information " is not worth stopping for . "
he repeated that the iranian nuclear program was peaceful and that iran was not seeking to obtain an atomic bomb , as the united states insisted .
he added , " we do not possess nuclear weapons and the international atomic energy agency has inspected the iranian facilities . "
the former iranian president hashemi rafsanjani , who is still influential in the iranian establishment , cautioned tuesday the united states against any military operation against iran .
the iranian news agency quoted rafsanjani saying that " we are not afraid of our foreign enemies ' threats and they know that as an old islamic country rich of its ancient history iran is not the place for adventures . "

dalian is a good example of that transition and will lead the transition of the whole area into new industries .
wang said dalian is hoping for more cooperation with britain , especially in the area of maritime shipping .
there are 71 british investment projects in dalian , most of which are in the fields of manufacturing , trade and service industry .
contractual investments are estimated at 430 million us dollars and actual investments at 158 million us dollars .

al-hassan said that the prominent people and tribal leaders of mosul , tikrit , baquba and ramadi had refused to participate in the elections and called for its boycott in case the provisional government rejected the demands of the people of those provinces to divide iraq into more than one electoral district and to represent the provinces in the national assembly according to population ratios .
he said that in spite of the iraqi popular desire to form an elected government so that the foreign forces leave iraq , it is impossible to conduct elections under the current security conditions .
the iraqi justice minister explained that it is not possible to guarantee the safety of voters when they go to vote and it is not possible to guarantee the safety of the candidate when he meets with his supporters to promote his election program .
a number of high level sunni muslim politicians had earlier urged the government to postpone the elections for six months to give the authorities enough time to secure voting centers and to convince sunni religious leaders to abandon their call for the boycotting of the elections .
but the spokesperson for the interim prime minister iyad allawi said that the government is committed to the january 30 date after receiving assurances from the iraqi electoral commission that it is possible to conduct elections even in the sunni areas destroyed by the insurgency .
for his part , the american president george w bush stressed on december 2 that the iraqi elections should be conducted as scheduled on the thirtieth of january saying that " time has come for the iraqi people to go to the voting boxes . "
african union expresses confidence in annan
addis ababa , december 6 / xinhua / the african union executive council today , monday , expressed its unshaken confidence in the united nations secretary general kofi annan , who is currently under fire because his son is accused of receiving commissions for seven years from a company participating in the united nations oil - for - food program for iraq .

kojo annan , the son of the secretary general , was investigated for corruption .
the corruption rumors surfaced in january when an iraqi newspaper published a list of about 270 prominent figures from at least 46 countries , saying they had received oil money from the regime of saddam .
the list was said to include one of the united nations officials benon sevan , who had been in charge of the program , but he vehemently denied that charge .
later , an american congressional committee accused the international organization of mismanaging the program and said it allowed saddam hussein to acquire more than 10 billion dollars from oil revenues .
annan launched an internal investigation in february but canceled it in march in preparation for a broader and more independent investigation .
the oil - for - food program started in december 1996 to allow iraq to export oil worth 69.5 billion us dollars .
the united nations oversaw iraq 's oil sales and its purchases of humanitarian supplies . the program was canceled in november of last year .

sources : illegal to nominate marwan barghouti to presidential elections
gaza december 11 / xinhua / palestinian sources close to the fatah movement said today , saturday , that nominating the secretary of the movement in the west bank marwan barghouthi , who is detained in israeli jails is illegal .
the sources , who wished to remain anonymous , explained that the candidacy of barghouti , who is imprisoned in israel on 5 life sentences " violates an article in the presidential electoral laws of the palestinian national authority . "
they added , " the law demands that any person running for the presidential elections resign any position he holds and present the resignation in written format to the general elections committee . this is especially the case for members of public authorities , judges and security personnel . the same applies for members of the palestinian legislative council . "
the sources noted , " hassan khreisheh , acting speaker of the legislative council , had to withdraw his decision to run for the presidential elections after he was notified by council members that he had to choose between staying a member of the council and submitting his resignation according to palestinian law . "
the sources confirmed " the same applies to barghouti , who announced his candidacy without resigning from the legislative council , which is a legal violation that would prevent him from moving forward with his candidacy for these elections . "

commentary : strange hint of " chinese threat " in japan 's defense program
tokyo december 11 / xinhua / the japanese government unveiled a ten - year defense program on friday which groundlessly describes china as a potential threat alongside the democratic people 's republic of korea .
while democratic korea has no diplomatic relations with tokyo , china is a country with which japan has signed a peace treaty and maintains very close economic ties .
although its wording was diplomatic , the outline of japan 's defense program mentions china and the democratic korea as the only neighbors that pose a threat to it .
" it is necessary to watch china 's nuclear and ballistic missile programs , the modernization of its navy and air forces and its attempts to expand marine activities , " said the document released by the japanese government on friday .
china and japan normalized their relations 32 years ago .
in addition to the treaty of peace and friendship signed six years later , the two countries agreed to upgrade their relations to a partnership in 1998 .
in the past three decades , trade has increased by more than 130 times and is expected to reach 150 billion us dollars this year .
china might become japan 's biggest trading partner in the very near future .
japan 's total investment in china amounts to 46 billion dollars .
a high degree of integration between the two countries ' economies has made long - term relations of friendship and peace between japan and china all the more important , not only for the two countries , but also for peace and prosperity in east asia and the whole world .
in this context , it is difficult to understand why japan would see china as a threat .
japan 's chief cabinet secretary hosoda hiroyuki tried to play down the " chinese threat " issue .
he told reporters on friday that the new defense program did not refer to china as a threat but as a country that deserves the attention of japan in the field of security .
commentary : " strange hint " of chinese threat in japan 's defense program / first and last addition /
however , his explanation did not even convince the japanese media , which pointed out that it was the first time japan 's defense program had mentioned a " chinese threat , " albeit in an indirect manner .
the japanese government 's move to highlight a " china threat " goes against the two peoples ' aspirations for lasting peace and friendship .
the chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman zhang qiyue expressed china 's " strong dissatisfaction " with the japanese move , commenting " this is totally groundless and extremely irresponsible . "
it is well - known that the chinese are peace - loving people .
a stronger china will not be a threat to any other country . instead , it will be a positive contribution to the development of its neighbors and to regional and global stability and prosperity .
china hopes that japan can seriously take into account its asian neighbors ' concerns and exercise caution in security and military security policies .
japan should stick to the course of peace and contribute to regional peace and development .
it is noteworthy to mention that japan appears to be following the united states with its security strategy .
it is possible that japan may be shifting its defense priority to counter - terrorism after the september 11 attacks and to the enhancement of defense capabilities against what it calls the " democratic korea threat . "
however , its unbelievably enthusiastic attitude toward a missile defense system in collaboration with the united states betrays its real intentions .
it is unconvincing at all that such a missile defense system is designed for the above - mentioned purposes only .

mark mccann , coalition spokesman told journalists here , " we are here to help afghanistan defeat the terrorist threat and ensure that the future of afghanistan is one of stability and peace .
and we are determined to remain here until our mission is complete . "

he said that the american commander was of the view that there were still elements with the intention to damage and the wish to introduce instability in the country .
the coalition forces led by the united states have been in constant rise since their deployment in afghanistan three years ago after the fall of taliban in 2001 .
the afghani government as well as the american administration have announced an amnesty for the taliban militia but the movement 's spokesman abdul latif hakimi rejected the offer as a " ploy to divide the militia " and vowed to fight till the end .

chinese scientists find dinosaur - eating mammal
beijing january 13 / xinhua / according to a report published today , thursday , chinese scientists have discovered a fossilized dinosaur - eating mammal in northeast china 's liaoning province

the fossilized mammal lived in the mesozoic era .
this discovery revealed that some large size mammals living in that era could have been carnivorous and brave enough to compete with dinosaurs for food and living space .
li said that undigested bones , including teeth and limbs , of a small dinosaur were found in its stomach .
li added that the unbroken joints meant that the mammal tore and gobbled the prey without biting and chewing
he said that before this latest discovery most scientists assumed that mammals of the mesozoic era were relatively small and nocturnal .
it was thought that they ate insects and dared not to reach dinosaurs .
li said that the new discoveries challenged the long - held view and proved that some primitive mammals were larger than medium - sized dinosaurs .
scientists had previously believed that they ate small animals and walked around in daylight .
based on this analysis , the devoured dinosaur was one - third of the size of the mammal .

russia recently offered to return two of the islands -- known as the southern kurils in russia and the northern territories in japan -- after the conclusion of a peace treaty , citing a joint declaration signed in 1956 by the soviet union and japan .
japan has demanded the return of all four islands -- which stretch from northern japan to the tip of russia 's kamchatka peninsula in the far east - saying it would lead to signing the peace treaty .
during machimura 's visit to moscow , both sides are expected to discuss the half - century - old territorial dispute , preparation work for putin 's tour to japan and bilateral economic cooperation , according to the itar - tass news agency .
other issues are expected to be discussed including the democratic people 's republic of korea and iraq .
