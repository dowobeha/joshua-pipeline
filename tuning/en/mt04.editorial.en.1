the alleged ( forceful ) " brothers " continue their claims by silencing those who stand in their place and block their ears to what they say .
they are deluded , or delude themselves , that french muslims have either fallen short of islam or been defeated .
so they need sheikh ahmad al-zain , judge of " sunni " ( hanafi shafai ) law in sidon , or those of his ilk , ( al-hayat , 6th of this month ) , to restore their right to them in wisdom and knowledge , or in volition and capacity .
and perhaps this is the heart of the issue and the matter .
thus the al-hudaibi " guide " , sheikh yusif al-qardawi , sheikh muhammad rashid qabbani , " sheikh " muhammad khatimi , sheikh muhammad hussein fadlallah , sheikh ahmad kaftaru and the others who follow their line , believe that muslims , whether born such or nurtured , are not themselves responsible for the matter of their belief and faith or jurisdiction over that belief and faith , which , in fact , lies with the " scholars " and those who issue fatwas .
the media has communicated the statement made by his eminence sheikh sayyid tantawi , sheikh of al-azhar , may god grant him and us success , in respect of the ban by the french government against female muslims covering their heads when going to school , including the part of the statement made by his eminence to the effect that this was the right of the french government . he said , " if a muslim woman is in a non - islamic state , such as france for example , and officials there want to impose laws that conflict with the issue of the veil for muslim women , that is their right .
that is their right .
that is their right . i reiterate that this is their right , to which i cannot object " ( " al-hayat 12/31/2003 ) .
the fact is that when i read the speech of his eminence the sheikh of al-azhar i was very surprised .
he is an eminent islamic figure and his position carries great weight all over the world .
i have met him on more than one occasion , including a visit i made to him in his office in november 1997 , when we were touched by his mild manners and his magnanimous dealings and we benefited from his view on the issues put forward , which stemmed from deep knowledge .
on account of this , surprise at the aforementioned statement was considerable .
the strong growth witnessed by the private sector last year was accompanied by numerous factors that led to consolidation of confidence in the national economy , which is expected to reflect positively on growth rates for the private sector for the current year as well .
these factors include the fall in interest rates on deposits in local currency in line with the low interest rates for the dollar , the permission granted to local and foreign private sector to invest in natural gas , electricity and water projects , and the privatization of part of the shares of the " saudi communications " company .
performance of the saudi stock market was good last year . the market index rose by 76.2% , supported by low local interest rates and high liquidity , in addition to the return of some saudi capital from abroad and good results for the saudi companies listed .
government expenditure in 2004 is also expected to exceed the levels estimated in the budget , i.e. the government will pursue the same expansionist policy that it followed last year , which led to growth in the government sector of 2% . at the same time , the saudi private sector is expected to grow by 4% , supported by low interest rates and surplus liquidity levels .
the growth of non - petroleum sectors , whether government or private , will compensate for the expected negative growth in the petroleum sector , thereby giving a 2% rise in the growth of gross national product at fixed prices this year .
after kuwait achieved growth in the region of 1% in gross national product at fixed prices for 2002 , this growth increased to 4% last year .
do the iraqi secularists realize that the united states has , for a long time , exploited the factors of backwardness spread by a humiliating subservience to western attitudes , specifically secularism , for which some among us call ?
and that it conceived of them as factors of weakness among the people of the arab and islamic region , which could be exploited to gain control of the region of the " middle east " , and plunder its natural resources ?
american centers for specialized studies thus endeavor to provide research that portrays the " third world " as lacking a scientific mind capable of investing in its natural resources , especially oil !
there are many examples of this , for those who want them .
hegemony , greed and interests characterize these policies .
it is an old policy in western thinking . it began when socrates and his pupils plato and aristotle drew parallels with the philosophy of hegemony and control of the other by calling for the supremacy of the western entity , which forms the basis of all hegemonies .
thus the well - known american economist adam smith said , " if every ( western ) individual pursued his individual interest , public prosperity would be certain . "
the demand by the iraqi kurdish leadership for a federation before free elections across iraq is unequivocal evidence of the kurdish leadership 's fear of the will of the kurdish people , and not of the minorities that penetrate so - called iraqi kurdistan .
the evidence for this is that this leadership has not , in 12 years , held elections in iraqi kurdistan , despite the possibility of doing so each year .
what has the government of kurdistan offered to the kurdish people other than fighting between the leaders of the al-barzani and al-talibani clans at the expense of kurdish blood ?
they have traded in this blood for 40 years .
as is the custom , when fighting breaks out between al-barzani and al-talibani it only stops when a third party becomes involved .
as is well known , this permanent peace between them arrived late at the hands of the american governor .
if fighting breaks out between them , within the borders of their federation , who then will intervene to stop the blood of the kurdish people being shed ?
the economic scene for the majority of egyptians since the liberalization decision to date has become influential in light of a conviction that any crisis can be dealt with , or its severity reduced , except the " crisis of confidence " . in the event that it gets out of control , it cannot easily be restored to its original state . the current climate is thus fertile ground for this to take place in light of the lack of transparency about the present conditions and the failure to involve the citizens in determining priorities in a serious manner .
however , both parties , the citizens and the government , must observe the consequence of the " bilateral boycott " , which has not been seen on the street since the 1977 bread crisis .
every government has its problems and crises , but in the end it is a nursemaid for the citizens , from the government of mamduh salim at the start of the 1970s to the governments of fuad muhyi al-din , kamal hasan ali , ali lutfi , atif sidqi and kamal al-janzuri .
but citizens view the present government with anger , as if it is the cause of their concerns , pain and suffering , despite the fact that the citizens themselves form a significant part of those concerns .
the population problem is growing out of control , ways of thinking about making a living are in decline and enthusiasm for life 's accessories increases without concern for the nature and value of income .
most citizens agree that the tone of irritation and vexation at the government interacts in light of the clear failure to deal with the crisis of rising prices , which are continually going up without any comparable increase in citizens ' income , bearing in mind that prices have gone up on average by 40% from july 2003 to date .
despite the repeated and decisive directives of president mubarak on the need to lighten the conditions of citizens and intensify meetings with the economic group , the government deals with the decision without proper implementation . recently , this has led some to call for the intervention of the party to cooperate with the government to draw up solutions .
mr. jihad al-khazin ( " al-hayat " 1/22/2004 ) authoritatively decided that the recent libyan decision to remove weapons of mass destruction was invalid , claiming that its timing was unfavorable and that it put pressure on states such as egypt , syria and iran .
the aforementioned authoritatively decided that the decision was no more than compliance with the american policy of the stick , citing the recent announcement of some american officials concerning the usefulness of the stick policy , which was employed in afghanistan and iraq , in libya moving to take this recent decision .
he cited a number of fabricated facts and corrupted statements in order to demonstrate that there is a libyan - israeli rapprochement on the horizons .
and , in the end , he did not forget to drive a wedge . he tried to intimate that aid from colonel muammar gaddafi to the palestinians only went to the extremist palestinian wings .
he sneered at the libyan leadership , stating that it had helped egypt by imposing visas on egyptians entering libya , just as it had helped the palestinians before by expelling them to the borders .
the taking of the recent libyan decision to get rid of weapons of mass destruction , and the timing thereof , are an issue that concerns only libya .
it knows best what conforms with and what conflicts with its interests .
when talk of the strength of the israeli deterrent diminishing and being constrained becomes a key component of the public message of the israeli government and its arms , the matter requires caution and wariness at new adventures to be undertaken by sharon and mofaz , and the chiefs of their army , to restore diminished israeli morale and the force of deterrent that has been hit dead center .
the palestinians must first take this into account , despite the fact that israel has turned them into a field experiment , trying out all forms of weapons against them . but the palestinian leadership must be wary and the people and the groups must also be wary .
hizbollah , its leadership and all of lebanon must also be wary of this " wounded animal " being set free .
syria and its leadership must be wary of new , more barbaric and deeper raids against syrian territory .
the leaders of the palestinian groups must be wary .
in all cases , and even if the view of the iraqi minister of trade is accepted as it is , a return to the past is futile . what is required is a way out of the present political and security impasse and for iraq 's independence to be reclaimed .
whilst i appreciate his personal qualities and morals , i spoke with and listened to mr. alawi without us agreeing
here , i find myself disagreeing with the ruling council . in my personal view it includes seven or eight patriotic members whose patriotism cannot be questioned , including , to be specific , adnan pachechi , whom i mention in his capacity as chairman of the ruling council this month .
however , there is a majority of middlemen and opportunity - seekers that returned to iraq on the back of the american tanks . they work for themselves , not for the good of iraq and the iraqis .
some members of the ruling council know that they will be finished if elections take place and so they oppose them taking place . the reader needs only to follow the proposals of some members of the council , such as the proposal to expand it and substitute it with the proposed national assembly .
exactly one year ago powell presented the terrifying scenario to the security council , announcing to it the " massive " amounts of biological and chemical weapons in iraq 's possession and the relations between the iraqi regime and the " al-qaeda " network .
he spoke about baghdad 's possession of nuclear weapons and about the presence of massive quantities of substances , such as " anthrax " and nerve gas .
on that day colin powell was transformed into the front for the hawks that drew up the war scenario before formulating the justifications therefor . he presented the terrifying scenario on their behalf in the international gathering .
this week powell spoke with two different tongues : he cast doubts as to whether he would hold the same position supporting war against iraq had he been told that this country did not possess an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction .
and he stressed that the invasion of iraq was " the right decision " , justifying the invasion on the grounds of iraq 's " intentions " , its capacity to produce weapons and the dangers of its regime , irrespective of the weapons store .
colin powell is a " soldier " bound by loyalty and he is a minister of foreign affairs in an administration that wants its president to be re - elected .
to an extent he can be excused , although history will later punish him .
what is no more than a lie in america is transformed into bombs on the heads of people abroad , a war that does not end and an on - going epic titled " pax americana " .
the issue is not related to the secret of politics , as is clear to clever writers such as christopher hitchens , who move from left to right as the center of gravity of the intelligentsia moves from left to right , with the shift towards policies of identity in the third world and the obliteration of the common universal language with the democratic forces in the west .
hitchens believes that the " wise men 's " preservation of the secret and their knowledge of the real war aim , which can only be stated through treatments , modifications , maneuvers and narration , is what makes the game attractive to intelligent men such as wolfovitz .
the truth is that this is also what makes the writing of christopher hitchens attractive . but there is nothing more to the matter .
it is also the consumption of scandals and secrets , but it is a sophisticated consumption , for the elite .
politics does not work like this .
those politicians who are dreamers and those who have an exclusive monopoly on ready facts , like the new conservatives , exploit political maneuvering and falsification for the end that they believe is noble .
mr. ali al-sistani grabbed an american promise by the collar and kept hold of it , a promise to establish democracy and hold elections on which the democratic system is to be based .
with this position he is helping the americans and the members of the ruling council to be serious .
it is the first test of the credibility of the promise of democracy to the region .
mr. al-sistani , as an authority to the religious majority in iraq , has taken the first steps through his demand for an elected committee to draw up the new constitution .
in this he has done nothing other than what all iraqis are striving for and has remained within the democratic framework that the americans are endeavoring to establish in iraq .
the constitution is an expression of an internal condition , notwithstanding the internationalization of constitutions .
in this sense , the new constitution should not anger anyone and thereby force them out of their peaceable context to demand their rights . constitutions are a guarantee that violence will not erupt , a guarantee of peaceful alternation , the stability of the state and society , as is the situation with the prevailing democratic constitutions .
al-sistani took his second democratic step after announcing a date and method for the transfer of power to the ruling council , which is what the americans mean by " the iraqis " .
however , doubts quickly spread that there was a hidden intent to surround the volition of the iraqi people and record the coming democracy in the name of the ruling council alone , or those known for their loyalty to it and to america directly .
legislative development was significant and important . but it should be noted that this legislative development in europe was subsequent to the efforts of the courts and confirmed that effort , whilst in the arab countries this development occurred to compel the courts to change their approaches , and the courts remained disobedient !
the judiciary in the arab countries continues to believe that arbitration does not take away its competence but its authority !
this nullifies the effect that the legislators were seeking when they amended the laws of arbitration and leads to the distancing of international arbitration from the arab countries towards the european states , where the judiciary is careful to protect the freedom of contract and the freedom of arbitration .
but what do you see in the arab states ?
saudi arabia : following the promulgation of the new saudi arbitration law , the sharia courts have continued to believe that the arbitration clause does not remove their competence , and they continue with the case notwithstanding the arbitration clause and notwithstanding the adherence of one of the two parties to the dispute to arbitration .
this is a case of one step forward , two steps back . it has not yet been resolved despite the explicitness of the modern saudi arbitration law , which acknowledges the arbitration clause .
syria : an international arbitration ruling was issued between the ( swiss ) company " stal a gestelle and alwiz " and the syrian " general fertilizer company " , a government company .
the scene transmitted by the screens was expressive .
abd al-qadir khan , father of pakistan 's nuclear bomb , came to president parvez musharraf and put the case in his hands .
he handed him a bomb , the damage from which the president will find hard to escape .
in his military jacket , musharraf appeared dumbfounded and confused .
what khan said was serious , very serious .
to put it simple , he confessed about the other side .
he had long swum in the nuclear black market .
he entered the bazaar and went far .
he leaked secrets and information to iraq , libya and north korea .
musharraf 's looks reflected the gravity of his situation .
he knows that the pakistanis love this man more than they love him .
they look to him as the hero who liberated frightened pakistan from its old complex towards india .
he gave to this frightened country that was born from a bloody divorce a feeling of security , that it would no longer be threatened or in need of assistance .
he gave it a feeling of strength and dignity .
the " fateh " movement was born 39 years ago .
its first bullets saved the cause from forgetfulness and sketched out the milestones along the way .
but the world in which it was born exists no more .
the struggle in which it was embroiled has witnessed transformations and exchanges .
it is thus not strange that it should be confused after all these corners .
it is not strange that it should see the submission of resignations and the distribution of accusations .
no one can deny the role of " fateh " .
no one can deny the role of yasir arafat .
but it is the right of every supporter of the palestinian issue to put the question as to whether the " fateh " leadership has taken all the decisions it should have in front of the internal and external challenges .
no names of prominent leaders were included in the letter of resignation submitted by 400 middle - ranking fateh cadres .
but the letter referred at one point to the scale of the confusion within the movement , which cannot be overlooked in the confrontation and negotiation with israel .
the signatories said that the movement began to corrode from within as a result of the internal contradictions .
i sit awaiting democracy . if it will not come in the american way , then it must reach us by the english one .
i have followed over the past few days the visit of libyan foreign minister mr. abdul rahman shalgam to britain . i noticed that when he was asked at a press conference about the murder of policewoman yvonne fletcher in front of the libyan embassy in 1984 , he responded by quoting the words of former british spy david shayler concerning the attempt by british intelligence to assassinate colonel muammar gaddafi .
britain and libya have thus " settled scores " with a life in return for an attempt to take a life . i just have to hear the view of the family of policewoman fletcher in the silence of the british foreign office on the matter .
prior to this the united states and britain suggested to the arab leaders that they follow the model of the brother colonel .
i imagine that what is meant is that they follow his model in stripping off and leave israel the only nuclear , chemical and biological state in the middle east .
this point needs clarification , to avoid someone thinking that what is required is to move from killing oppositionists and a british policewoman to terrorist operations , to bringing down two civilian aircraft , to the kidnap of civilians , etc. before getting rid of weapons of mass destruction that only exist in the imagination of the democratically renewable libyan leader .
i will not irritate the reader with a full article about libya . i merely want some democratic phenomenon , the blessings of which have passed us by in the middle east .
today iran goes to the polls to come back the loser .
a quarter of a century ago the proposals of al-khomeini attracted the people .
they supported them and went down to the streets .
they shouted and intimated with their fists .
the state of the shah fell .
the army was disbanded , and with it savac , and every mechanism of suppression and repression .
a quarter of a century since the victory of revolution by the people , the regime of the revolution is going to the polls in fear of them .
the issue does not concern the future of muhammad khatimi .
from the beginning it has been no secret that he is a president in the age of the guide .
the issue concerns the future of the regime , the revolution and the country .
the past few weeks have revealed the extent of the fear gripping the extremists , who are worried by the wind penetrating to the citadel of the revolution .
they can no longer stand the dance of democracy , despite the pressures and brakes applied by the constitution .
the final word granted by the constitution to the guide is no longer sufficient to reassure them .
despite his reticent behavior and inclination to reconciliation , concession and coexistence , muhammad khatimi has sown disturbing questions in the body of the regime .
paul bremer is unfortunate .
his suffering is more than can be tolerated .
he was tasked to arrange something that is difficult to order and to market something that is impossible to sell .
the iraqis did not believe that he came on a humanitarian mission and that his concern was to make a beautiful future for them .
suspicion , dissatisfaction and anger are the custom of the iraqis .
unfortunate . his mission is tiring .
the joy at saddam 's downfall did not last long .
the iraqi people have returned to their fundamental constituent parts .
talking to the " sunni triangle " is impossible .
satisfying the kurdish allies is difficult because it provokes the anger of allies and friends at home and abroad .
he addresses the shia in the ruling council and they point with their fingers to najaf .
the man sat in najaf does not receive him , preferring the united nations to the united states .
an exhausting mission .
time is running out .
there is nothing to be gained by digging up the recent past .
there is nothing to be gained by renewing the debate about the usefulness of the american war against iraq , its being waged without international authorization and the principle of the pre - emptive strike .
for this reason george bush discussed the present and the future with his guest gerhardt schroeder and avoided the vexations of the recent past .
it was in the interest of the american president that he refute the claims of the democrats that the manner of his administration in dealing with foreign policy has lost the united states european allies , including germany , which is playing a field role in afghanistan .
bush knows that he needs the " intractable " europeans to encourage the united nations to play a role in iraq that will facilitate the united states ' operation to end the occupation and the elections and building of institutions thereafter .
he will also need the intractable europeans in any potential nato role .
and because the season is one of elections , the master of the white house gave indications that reflect his magnanimity .
american secretary of defense james schlesinger summoned british ambassador in washington lord cromer and informed him that the united states would not tolerate the threat of a " backward , scarcely populated " state and that he did not dismiss the possibility that the united states would use military force .
he disregarded other possibilities , such as the replacement of the present stubborn arab leaders with " cooperative leaders " , or the threat of gunboat diplomacy .
the ban announced by the arab opec member states aimed to put pressure on the united states and other western states to force them to withdraw from arab territory . it continued until march 1973 . the united states lost just 13% of its imported oil but that caused it massive problems .
schlesinger estimated that the operation would initially need two brigades , one for the kingdom of saudi arabia and the other for kuwait , and perhaps a third for the emirate of abu dhabi , with the help of britain .
this was 30 years ago . the news these days , all of which is published and correct , includes :
the kingdom of saudi arabia now produces about eight million barrels of oil per day and can increase production to ten million . it intends to maintain production levels within a limit of 5.1 million barrels until 2011 .
anyone following circumstances in iraq has the right to ask whether there is a thread linking the bloody strikes directed against different groups .
they have the right to ask whether the thread linking the explosions and assassinations targeting religious or political figures is to submerge the field in bloody chaos that puts an end to the hope that an iraqi authority capable of providing security and stability may emerge .
one can also ask whether the explosions also aim to disturb the stability of the whole region by means of the toxins that could be spread by bloody contact lines between the fundamental constituent parts of the iraqi people .
this is without us forgetting an important question , namely , has iraq been transformed into a field of wars that are bigger than it , notably the war being launched against those targeted by the " war on terror " launched in the wake of september 11 , 2001 ?
it is clear that yesterday 's massacre aimed to stoke the flames .
the selection of the locations of the crime and the manner in which it was carried out aimed to launch a series of reactions that would submerge iraq in a hellish circle , one from which it could not get out .
and because the mobile discord is this serious , the iraqis would be better served in formulating a response that went beyond the counsel of the wise men and the statements of condemnation and denunciation .
the iraqis have not accused the americans of involvement in the explosions that besmeared kerbala and baghdad the day before yesterday .
the americans have fundamentally no interest in an act of this kind .
for such involvement means driving the large shiite bloc to become involved in the armed resistance .
such involvement could set iraq alight beneath the feet of the occupation .
by contrast , the american administration has , in the past months , seemed to suggest that the bloody strikes against the " coalition forces " , international headquarters and religious figures are the work of a resistance from abroad .
the massacres the day before yesterday do serve what the americans are striving to promote , since it is difficult to believe that what is taking place serves the program of any iraqi groups .
the iraqis have not accused the americans after it transpired that suicide attacks were involved in the kerbala and baghdad massacres .
but iraqi parties have accused the americans of failing to shoulder responsibility as an occupying power .
they accused them of deficiencies in security measures .
the truth is that it is difficult to imagine a secure situation in light of the occupation , even were a date set for it to end .
it is difficult to combine the occupation and security , especially in this country and this region in particular .
from today to the summit of eight there will be much talk about the " greater middle east initiative " , which is based on the greater middle east partnership .
this has put the cart behind the horse , for it supposes a cooperation between the states of the middle east and israel , whilst the latter continues killing and destruction , as if the palestinians are from another world and their affair does not concern the arabs and muslims in the region .
i pause to record a point of skepticism , one for which i have no evidence other than that i know the likudite sharonites in the american administration who draft the american projects , and those around it who support only israel .
the point is that the aim of the greater middle east is to include turkey , iran , afghanistan and pakistan , thereby making the arabs a minority part of the project .
however , what the plan drafters ignore on account of their israeli blindness is that muslims are perhaps more willing to aid the palestinians than the arabs . ask any turk , pakistani , iranian or afghan for their view on the subject .
in any case , the greater middle east initiative relies heavily on the arab human development plan for 2002 and 2003 .
the plan spoke of three " deficiencies " , in freedom , knowledge and female emancipation , and the initiative speaks of three needs , to encourage democracy , build a knowledge society and expand economic opportunity .
america is a big problem .
to be friendly with it is costly and to be at odds with it prohibitive .
it is difficult for countries to live today as if america did not exist .
it is necessary to obtain a certificate of international good behavior .
its agreement is necessary for fair elections and good management of the economy .
its signature is needed on the government 's record in the sphere of human rights .
it is needed to gain access to the gifts of the international monetary fund and the world bank .
it is futile to seek the protection of the security council unless it is satisfied .
the reports of its envoys are important and usually decisive .
without its awesome military machine , slobodan milosevic would not be sat behind bars .
without the pressure of that same force , saddam hussein would be living in the palace intimating of the new " mother of battles " .
it is needed to stop a civil war and encourage the president to take the route of exile .
when ramon does not find what he can use to lie , he seeks the help of others . in one of the chapters he attributes to the american secretary of defense donald rumsfeld his statement that tehran helped al-qaeda and taliban to get their men out via iran .
via iran to where ?
rumsfeld 's words were published in january 2002 and we now know that every charge directed by the american administration before the war against iraq was false .
on the matter of iran to be specific , it almost launched war against the taliban after its diplomats and nationals were killed in afghanistan , and there is absolutely nothing to link it with al-qaeda and taliban .
but ramon continues to lie , citing a report penned by michael evans in the " times " about an official in al-qaeda who offered to infiltrate its elements into lebanon .
israel hopes for this and sends those who promote its false hopes , but it has not happened and will not happen .
the booklet concludes with what israeli does actually want . ramon proposes political and economic pressure on syria and iran to stop supporting hizbollah . in a previous chapter he seems confused , suggesting one time that syria 's support is the most important and another that iran 's is so .
perhaps the spanish socialist leaders would not like to hear any doubts in respect of the ideological or value dimension to the struggle started by the war in iraq , especially in respect of the french position .
the spanish , from the right to the left , especially the left , acknowledge that spain had significant interests in the iraq of saddam hussein , not , of course , on the same scale as the massive french interests , over all the past era .
just as they acknowledge , in particular the right , longstanding american double standards towards iraq , especially during the 1980s .
the density of the political and cultural dimensions in the struggle occasionally , in conversations with the spanish concerned , lightens the essence of the struggle over foreign policy between france and germany on the one hand and washington on the other , which , in essence , is a struggle over interests .
however , anyone touring spanish institutions , in addition to the streets of madrid and later barcelona , perceives the importance of the european role in a country like spain .
spain is a model of the state whose more advanced european surroundings have helped drive the wheel of development to the point where it has today undoubtedly become a state on an advanced and advancing scientific , cultural and economic footing .
in fact , the spanish economy , within the european vehicle , has moved from being one that exports workers to one that imports workers with legal residence , who , today , for the most part , are from latin america , with a percentage ( about one third ) from the states of arab north africa .
the new iraqi officials , former oppositionists , continue to behave in their contacts with their counterparts in other states with the mentality of oppositionists in need of every assistance and service from this or that state .
they have not yet come to believe , or , more properly , have not yet become accustomed , to behave as the men of a state preparing to become healthier than it was in the past .
the occasion for these words is the manner of behavior of the iraqi officials who visited lebanon , via syria , in the past weeks , the last of which was the delegation of the ruling council , that council which , until the recent past , was " illegal and did not represent the iraqi people " according to the statements of senior officials who embraced its delegation in welcome last week . glory to him who changes affairs !
what is notable in the statements of the head of the delegation , muwaffaq al-rabii , following his meeting with lebanese prime minister rafiq al-hariri , was his statement that he had asked him to provide facilities to iraqis to enter and resident in lebanon , to discuss how to develop iraqi lebanese relations , and even stranger and more naïve , he asked him to " improve iraq 's new image with the brother arabs " .
is it reasonable for such a request to be made from an official in a state possessing this pride and dignity ?
and who authorized mr. al-rabii to violate the dignity of the iraqis by such a plea , which is insulting to iraq and its people ?
and if al-rabii was unaware of the criteria that govern the relations of states he should at least have sought the aid of advisors .
we have hesitated on more than one occasion as we intended this frank talk . we warned against the policy of making ministries into compounds of favoritism and we previously gave an undertaking to behave as a positive opposition .
an opposition that monitors government and rulers and tries to straighten out its deviations , which are , unfortunately , manifold .
an opposition along the lines of the western opposition , which must remain strong , exactly as british prime minister tony blair hoped for his country when he said that he was sad because the opposition was weak .
we reassure ministers and say to them : do n't be sad for your opposition , which , in view of your massive mistakes , is strong and appears to be getting stronger by the day .
the iraqis say the expression " the cup overflows " forcefully as they watch in unbridled surprise the state of corruption , favoritism , bribery and deal - making state to which the departments , ministries and the ruling council in the country have sunk .
these defects , to which we had thought our new iraq had said farewell for good , are returning and getting worse .
even the drawing of lots for pilgrimage , the most sacred of religious duties , has been dressed up and the poor applicant has been deprived so that it can be given to a strong leader .
the main motive requiring the re - implementation of the judicial provisions on the death penalty is , as you said , " to cover the scandal of the culture of civil war , the accumulative consequences of which have been revealed by the records of criminals " who have been killed in the manner we witnessed on january 17 , 2004 .
but this may not be the only motive encouraging officials to take the decision today to implement the death penalty provisions against criminals selected according to criteria that concern not the seriousness of the crime perpetrated but also their sectarian allegiance , in order to maintain the sectarian equivalence .
the explanation for implementation of the death penalty provisions may also lie in the culture of deterrence , suppression and installing fear .
for it aims to create an atmosphere of fear in the souls of not just those thinking of perpetrating a given crime for different reasons but also in the souls of those seduced , in the belief of the authority , by the idea of freedom , liberation , opposition or overthrow of the regime and the composition currently ruling , or even the idea of revolt at this sensitive stage through which the region is passing , which scares many rulers .
for this reason the message was implicit , but it was clear at the same time for those who pay heed .
in relation to the statement that lebanon has not become the " state of law " which would enable it to abolish the death penalty , we unequivocally agree with you in the view that lebanon has not yet become the " state of law " , or , more properly , the " state of right " in the true european sense of the word , etat de droit , such as the states of western europe , canada , japan and other states , albeit that lebanese legislation is , for the most part , legislation that aims to make lebanon a " state of law and institutions " .
the practical reality into which lebanon has stumbled is clear evidence that it is , as you say , a " lawless state " or " state without rights " .
what 's the matter with the lebanese political leadership ? we only hear them open their mouths to say great things . they only talk about the confrontation with israel , about the resistance and about spreading the culture of resistance , when lebanon 's domestic crisis is the basis on which we should start to deal .
how do they want to spread " the culture of resistance " in the arab world when the lebanese are ruled by an influential minority that sees nothing of their suffering except the manifestations of subservience and frightening favoritism into which citizens are forced at all stages of their existence and in all the interests of their lives .
talk about the resistance and the weapon of resistant is important , if not critical . but what can the lebanese do when they follow the reports of mass deals and scandals and examine the on - going conspiracy of the ruling class .
whether they be loyalist or oppositionist , civilian or otherwise , economic or judicial - an on - going conspiracy affecting a majority that is without sect , color or identity , nothing but needy , almost contemptible , in the heart of the influential minority that see no one to call them to account , to stop them and deter them ?
we are living in the shadows of a culture of political hypocrisy and duplicity .
we are living in the shadows of a new type of class system .
a class system of struggle , resistance , patriotism , finance , military , intelligence and mafia , all of which feed off the people 's silence and their acceptance of the crumbs from the table .
the people accept that they should be ruled by the criteria of a class system older and more arrogant than the old class systems about which we were often told that they had caused the war .
no , the wolf ariel sharon has not changed his skin .
he 's playing fast and loose in response to the requirements of the present stage , but his teeth and claws continue to attack .
there is a coming need to maneuver , one that is required by a personal file colored by bribery and , of course , imposed by the white house visit , at a time when george bush 's stock appears to be falling .
so there can be absolutely no objection to sharon letting off a sound bomb with echoes , one the reverberations of which reach many places :
first : to the corruption file that is drawing tight around him and includes his two sons , omri and gilad , meaning that talks about the withdrawal from the settlements in gaza and the north west bank will shift the spotlight focused on the bribery file to the subject of settlement .
secondly : to the united states and george bush , where talk about the withdrawals appears an attempt to say that he will implement the clauses stipulated by the " road map " whilst the palestinians have not implemented the clause to end the violence and " terrorism " .
thirdly : to the sites of his extremist allies in the government , who have always tried to impose on him their conditions , even though these conditions do not entirely contradict with his policies .
throughout these years of talks , and within the framework of the united nations " oil for food " program , the " sonatrac " company has been able to take part in the marketing of a part of iraqi oil .
in this way , and at each stage of the export of the iraqi oil , a share was allocated to us equivalent to the shares of the other petroleum companies , including the american ones , via the " sonatrac " branch in london .
all of this took place with the knowledge and agreement of the united nations and not directly with the iraqis .
perhaps it is for this reason we were called on to organize humanitarian activities for the iraqi people .
we also sent aid in the form of medicine , medical equipment and foodstuffs .
we supervised the training of about 60 iraqi oil engineers in algeria . we also opened an office in baghdad and took part in organizing working trips for company directors , which comprised two trips each year to monitor the oil for food program in the field .
there are many points of similarity between the iranian situation in the stage that followed the collapse of the shah 's regime in 1979 and the iraqi situation after america overthrew saddam hussein 's regime .
the greatest similarity is apparent in the administrative confusion and the move by members of the former regime ( the shahanshahi in iran and the baath in iraq ) to change their colors and adopt the slogans of the new situation .
but in practice they continue the policy of their previous regime whenever they find a hole through which they can slip .
this situation applies to some of iraq 's embassies , which have recently reopened . many iraqis in exile thought this a good sign but many have been shocked by the reality of these embassies .
in the era of the previous regime all iraqis were suffering .
at home the phantom of wars and death in the form of the intelligence services pursued everyone , even those who thought that they were acceptable to the regime or enrolled in its policy .
abroad , the regime pursued hundreds of thousands who succeeded in fleeing the millstone of daily death using its intelligence services and constraining iraqis in exile , the least example of which was to deprive them of passport renewal or certification of their documents because the price in return for this would be no less than an undertaking to work as informants for the embassy , which , in matter of fact , was an intelligence cell .
it is rare for democracy to accompany war or for war to lead to the establishment of democratic systems , i.e. the handing over of power to the people as opposed to keeping it in the hands of the generals , officers , majors and sergeants .
this is because there is a fundamental opposition between military and democratic culture .
the first is based on singularity by virtue of rank , orders , obedience and the imposition of order and control over anything else , even where wrong , pursuant to the golden role that says , " do it first , then object , " even where it involves cutting off someone 's head .
the second is based on consultation and dialogue , the precedence of public interests over individual ones , whilst accepting the right to differ and object , and acknowledges no right that is not established by law , believing that the people are the source of the authority , thereby granting legitimacy and calling to account directly or indirectly .
accountability in cultural democracy is the golden rule to guarantee " control " , i.e. order , and the separation of powers in such a way that prevents one power dominating another , or one person gaining control of an institution , with each power responsible for limiting the other , without them fighting between each other , or conspiring and relying on each other in the service of their interests ahead of the public interest , which is the interest of the people in all its individuals . the fall of these powers in its view is the loss of legitimacy they have acquired .
no two people with a bare minimum of economic perception will disagree that lebanon will face difficult financial circumstances threatening it with bankruptcy within a short period of time unless there is a renaissance , which , at present , would be tantamount to a miracle .
optimists speak of june 2005 as a circumstance from which there can be no escape , unless lebanon succeeds on the occasion of the presidential elections in renewing international confidence in it , which , today , is nonexistent after the paris commitments have been lost in the war between the heads of the state .
this confidence , as those working in the economy know , is hostage to the partnership with the european union .
no matter how great the friendship of french president jacque chirac for greater lebanon , and no matter how great his distinguished relationship with prime minister rafiq al-hariri ( assuming that the latter remains in his position ) , there can be no paris without european agreement .
this is what gives the position that emerged in brussels during the meeting of the cooperation and partnership council meeting with lebanon critical importance .
of course , no sooner had the european stance reached beirut than everyone rose against this barefaced intervention in the internal affairs of lebanon , in order to recall full sovereignty , independence and immunity against foreign intervention .
there is no harm in this . we have lots of time to criticize . but let 's first listen to what the intervention comprises .
many were those who went to perform their " religious " duties in all humility before his majesty satan ( the camera ) , including witnesses who bore false testimony , silent witnesses and the usual suspects , at the end of each of the two sessions seen in al-nijmah square , which were known to have absolutely no value even beforehand other than being an additional verbal brawl for those who were not , are not and will not be concerned by it .
the evidence is that after the first session their media kitchen spread the idea of no winner and no loser in a number of media .
this is an incorrect notion in two respects :
the first is that there is a clear , politically dominant group who control the cell phone sector within the lebanese balance of powers run by syrian authority , a balance that includes in the " economic " partnership numerous sectors with various beneficiaries , some lebanese , some not .
the second is that there are those morally scandalized in this file , specifically , who have lost , in moral terms , before those who scandalized them and they have in no way succeeded in regaining a level footing with them .
so , in fighting terms , those divulging the scandal have won politically .
was pentagon hawk richard perle the " scapegoat " whose friend , member of the interim ruling council ahmed chalebi , offered to be such if bush 's administration wanted one , in order to put an end to the scandal of erroneous intelligence information about iraq prior to the war ?
or did he choose to resign from the defence policies board at the pentagon in order to continue his profitable projects and business in iraq ?
the reason given by perle for his resignation , namely that he did not want his provocative views to affect the election campaign of president george bush , appears the least significant .
for dogmatics of perle 's ilk do not resign so easily from an influential position such as this .
he has spent 17 years therein and has been unshaken by his name being linked to more than one scandal , the least of which was in the past year .
even his relinquishment of the board chair and his remaining a member thereon last year was not related to these scandals .
to uncover the reason , one must search in the iraqi dimension , where perle is wrapped up in two issues : first , profitable deals relating to the reconstruction of iraq and , prior to this , the war , in which investigations have begun and include the hollinger and boeing companies .
one of the conclusions is also that the americans have not seen a more difficult palestinian - israeli situation than that at present .
for , not only is there the most right wing and extreme government in israel 's history , there is also an uncompromising israeli public opinion that believes the background to the survival and continuation of this government , and the one feeds of the other .
as regards the palestinians , the americans believe that they are in their worst situation because civilians , with the exception of the islamists , have no power to advance in the talks with sharon or confront him .
this situation , in turn , leads to the conclusion that there is very little that can be done to improve the situation on the ground .
diplomats concerned with such information do not , in principle , oppose the american conclusion in this regard , especially the impossibility of achieving anything at present or the frightening circumstances in which the palestinians live . however , they believe that this situation is the logical result of israel 's persistent attempts , since october 2000 at least , to destroy all the bases for the construction of the palestinian state .
the americans have not failed to drive in this direction by keeping quiet about sharon 's practices , which have taken the cover of the united states ' war on terror to destroy all the foundations on which the palestinian entity could be based , or by striking against the palestinian authority itself , represented in the person of yasir arafat , and abolishing all potential for cooperating with him , thereby facilitating his isolation for israel and placing all the palestinian authority in quarantine .
one of the curious things about president ilyas al-harawi is that when he wanted to include the quarrelsome ministers in the council of ministers , those whom he believed might oppose his view on an issue he wanted to submit to it outside the agenda , he would begin his speech to present the issue , " there is a proposal from minister abdallah amin , " who was a member of one of the governments in al-harawi 's time and also the country secretary for the baath party in lebanon .
after presenting the issue , whatever it was , he would intimate to his ministerial corroborators in a whisper that " the brothers were on board " and not far from the " proposal " . of course , he meant the " syrian brothers " , which was sufficient to ensure the proposal was passed without objections or obstacles , when , for practical purposes , it was al-harawi 's own proposal .
president al-harawi related this anecdote on more than one occasion and many have recalled it over the last two days in the context of reading the recent words of minister sulaiman faranjiyyah , which were significant and by means of which he violently attached prime minister rafiq al-hariri , accusing him of stepping out of line of which he , namely al-harari , was one of its buttresses . but he intimated that he was helpless in his commitment to the " patriotic pan - arab line " , which expresses commitment to the alliance with syria .
much was said about the words of faranjiyyah , who is known for his very special relationship with the syrian leadership , which , in depth and steadfastness , is historically between the asad family and that of faranjiyyah , " of father from grandfather " , which none of syria 's lebanese allies and friends has achieved .
one of the distinctions of this relationship is that sulaiman faranjiyyah often makes exaggerated statements , which , for many , reach the level of flattery and hypocrisy , to the extent that they can lose their meaning .
on the basis of this relationship , many have read in the part of faranjiyyah 's words relating to al-hariri " a syrian message " .
such a legitimate deduction , albeit that it appears realistic for a moment , also appears " imprecise " .
so , as long as we have freedom , then let us enjoy it whatever the consequences .
this thinking no longer appears theoretical with some sectors of the population . in fact , it has been applied for a long time .
examples include : the freedom of non - accountability , which keeps rulers away from any genuine attempt to call them to account .
officials make mistakes and blunders of the kind that cause massive losses for the country and citizens .
but the freedom they exercise puts them in a position of being able to appear honest .
the freedom of non - explanation , which makes equal those who do the right thing and those who do the wrong , letting loose the rhetorical phrases appropriate to the phase that extends from the dawn of history to the far - off future .
in the recent debates of the chamber of deputies , the iraqi petroleum coupons , the disaster of the kotono aircraft and the long story of the al-madinah bank we have examples that are still alive .
on account of the freedom of non - explanation everyone will feel reassured and at ease . there is no specific person accused , merely accusations . there is no one who has acted wrongly whose identity , capacity , position , pedigree and nobility of birth can be determined , merely a litany of errors .
in most , if not all , of his recent meetings the syrian president has been careful to underline three stances , which echo what he seems keen to stress as syria 's thinking at the present time :
first , his repeated praise of maronite patriarch mar nasrallah butrus safir , his appreciation of his wisdom in dealing with the dangerous developments confronting the region and , on the basis of this stance , his concern for everything that will reassure and put the christians at ease .
secondly , emphasis of his support for president emil lahud , above and beyond his national and strategic options , stressing his confidence in the " intent of the state 's venture " , which the president of the republic is maintaining at one remove from fanaticism and private interests .
this is what more than one visitor has heard from the syrian president .
thirdly , al-asad 's frustration at the failure of some of damascus ' allies to appreciate the danger and sensitivity of the stage , their continued submergence in the internal situation as part of a political battle , and their playing with files that , at the present time , cannot stand such opulence or passion for internal conflicts , irrespective of whether these relate to the matter of the presidency or the management of the government and its files , including the recent cell phone file .
i asked a minister who is a friend for his view on the stance of the recent archbishops ' council on the presidential election . he responded by stressing the importance of this old / new position , which has , in total frankness , dotted the i 's and crossed the t 's , both in terms of the specifications for the person of the president and the mechanism for his selection .
he said that the position was now very clear and stopped in their tracks the many interpretations and leaks on the matter of the presidency , the event which bikirki confirms within the framework of respect for laws and safe - guarding of the constitution .
i then asked him about the real reasons that led to the failure of president emil lahud 's efforts to implement his reform project and about those who , according to him , obstructed this project . he shook his head without giving me a reply . i then asked him about the names of those who obstructed the implementation of this project . i also did not receive any response .
i said to him : is it reasonable for you not have any reply in response to what president lahud stated on the matter of the reform and the obstruction thereof ?
he shook his head once more , limiting himself to , " restricted ! "
i then asked myself : can anyone determine decisively that president lahud has a reform project ?
and who has seen it ?
it seemed hilarious when egyptians foreign minister ahmad mahir and secretary - general of the arab league amr musa stood before the journalists and endeavored to keep the " impregnable secret " under wraps and maintain the complete black out that surrounded the " document for developing joint arab action " .
why all this care for secrecy and mystery ?
is it because the arab citizen and public opinion in the arab states have not the right to know the affairs and ideas concerning the future of arab action , free from evil , or is it because these matters are solely the preserve of regimes and rulers , and the people , ultimately , have to wear the cloth tailored by the sacred leadership .
it seemed hilarious because citizens in the arab states had read the report by the " ap " agency concerning the saudi - egyptian reform initiative entitled , " an undertaking and declaration for the arab people " , which called for greater participation of arab peoples in the administration of their political , economic , social and cultural affairs .
how can these people participate in these delicate and important matters if the " document " agreed upon by the arab foreign ministers to develop joint arab action is to remain an impregnable secret , as we said , before being revealed to the people after consensus at the arab summit in tunisia , if indeed there is such consensus ?
and why the skepticism about the possibility of it being convened ?
late prime minister rashid karami once preferred to resign before the council of deputies at the start of the session to avoid giving the opposition , which was threatening his government with a vote of no confidence , the opportunity to score one over him .
addressing his words to emil al-bustani , leader of the opposition campaign against the government on that day , he said as he resigned , " by depriving you of the pleasure of bringing down the government by withdrawing confidence , i will leave your heart to burn . "
loyal deputies used not to note the quorum of the sessions , unless the opposition deputies came to be in a position capable of bringing down the government by withdrawing confidence . in fact it was the opposition deputies who , by virtue of their being a minority , resorted to noting the quorum because they lacked the confidence of a guaranteed majority .
on his view on the dispute between the prime minister and the minister of communications concerning the cell phone , he said : " if those in power were governed by constitutional institutions their differences would have been settled . what has happened would not have happened , not just in this matter , but in every other matter .
the difference between the view of prime minister al-hariri and those who share it , and the view of minister qirdahi and those who share that , should be decided in the council of ministers . the ministerial majority will either support this view or that . this will enable the government to face the council of deputies with a united view and stance on the matter .
the government must , for its part , defend its view in the council of deputies and explain its view and stance in respect of every point raised . either the deputies will be persuaded , in which case the matter is over , or they will remain unconvinced , in which case the majority of deputies will decide by voting on the dispute in hand , either in favor of the opposition or in favor of the government and its supporters , in which case the matter will be closed . it will not remain open , as is the case , without people knowing where the truth lies , whether in reference to the cell phone revenue figures or the conditions for the tender and public sale .
syria and the lebanese regime that emerged from the taif accord blamed most christian political , party and religious figures for the very widespread christian boycott of deputy elections that was conducted in 1992 after nearly two decades of the 1972 chamber of deputies being extended as a result of the civil and non - civil war that broke out in the country in 1975 .
at the time the boycott was considered a form of envelopment of the taif accord , especially by some of the parties who supported it at that time . indeed , had they not sponsored and understood it , it would never have seen the light of day .
it was also considered a reference to the fact that some of the said group wanted a truce that would enable them to catch their breath and reorganize the ranks in preparation for entering a decisive or critical battle with the syrian military and political presence in lebanon when the conditions were right .
at the time syria punished those who engaged in the boycott by keeping them out of the first government of taif , if one may put it like that . however , following a reappraisal of the lebanese domestic situation and its interests in lebanon , and consequently in the region , it gave the green light for some of those to participate in the second government .
the manner in which this group acted intimated to damascus , despite their accepting participation and even at a reduced level , that something had not changed in their strategic position towards syria and its regime in lebanon .
naturally , syria was vexed by this , but did not think it a " disaster " because christian representation in the taif governments and thereafter , as in the case of the other institutions of state , was largely reasonable .
on the one hand there is the most prominent northern christian leader , sulaiman faranjiyyah .
and , on the other , there is the former " leader " of the " lebanese forces " , eli hubaiqah .
the official arab regime , which is in crisis , most resembles a car falling into a pit at a high speed , increasing as time passes and lacking the brakes that would help it to stop the momentum , or even to reduce it .
this is the official arab scene that looks out over us from the cairo meetings . an excessive confusion at the flood of foreign " initiatives " , which are close to colonial dictation wrapped up in a contemporary guise , fortified by a range of " international reports " .
a strong feeling of impotency and weakness in the face of the collapse of official arab immunity ( excluding its intelligence and police facet , which remains intractable ! ) .
the defeat of saddam 's iraq , and the subsequent occupation of the largest arab state , is a harsh message to the coup arabs and the military secretariat that the time of delusional victories is over or that full stomachs will not exempt people from despondency , despair and resorting to violence .
in spite of which the stomachs that were full in the past are increasingly empty .
and the time of revolution and impetuosity , or the so - called age of oil innocence , is over .
the appraisal by president amin jemayel of the presidential elections differs from some of what was said in this regard in the last few weeks in that he sees it as a real opportunity for syria not just to create change in lebanon alone , but also to confirm its desire to expand the scope of such change to include it as well .
this viewpoint leads him to disregard any american role in the coming lebanese presidential elections for reasons some of which can be ascribed to the fact that lebanon is no longer an immediate american interest . others can be ascribed to the fact that american interest is focused at present on the new middle east , in which reform and democracy prevail , and in which lebanon is nothing but a minor detail . whilst a third group can be attributed to american - syrian relations , in which lebanon must be a clause .
notwithstanding this , the former president insists on opposing extending the term of president emil lahud and does not hesitate to correct an old phalangist base , believed to have been the subject of deliberate distortion recently , namely that the support of the phalangist party for the president of the republic , any president of the republic , has never led to support for his term to be renewed or extended .
this was the state of the party in respect of president bisharah al-khuri when it participated in the campaign to bring him down in 1952 , and then with president fuad shihab when it opposed his remaining in power for a new term in 1964 .
he thus sees in article 49 a source of strength for the lebanese regime , as it first provides the opportunity for a circulation of authority in a way that arab regimes neighboring lebanon submerged in dictatorship are not accustomed and , secondly , paves the way for accountability and a calling to account of the president , who knows that his term has an end and so does not persist in the offence .
following an awesome national , official and popular funeral for martyr and prime minister rashid karami in tripoli , a meeting was held at the karami family palace with the participation of the majority of those who attended the dar al-fatwa meeting with syrian vice president abd al-halim khaddam , who appeared angry at the decision issued by the said meeting and who spoke of haste when " the blood of the martyr had not yet dried " .
he then turned to al-hiss , saying , " when you come to visit us in damascus , remind me to play you a recording that will reveal how preparation was made for the attempt on your life , so that you will know who the criminals are . "
some days later , al-hiss visited damascus accompanied by al-husseini and they met khaddam , who said when al-hiss asked him about the promised recording , " do you want to hear the case from the mouth of eli hubaiqah ? "
al-hiss responded , " let me hear it from you . "
khaddam told the story of a meeting that included hubaiqah , the heads of two security organizations in the time of al-jemayel and pillars of his government at the home of the leader of the deputies ' bloc and a current deputy who visited al-hiss in 1990 especially to confirm that he had nothing to do with the explosion that targeted him .
al-hiss recounts the story with the names and facts in his book " for truth and history " on pages 53,54 and 55 .
is it true that the united states of america is unconcerned by the matter of the presidency in lebanon and by who is selected president of the republic , in contrast with its previous stance ?
the fact is that opinions differ in this regard .
a former minister of foreign affairs says that the united states of america is not concerned with the matter of the presidency , as was the case in the past , because the lebanese state has , since the taif accord , begun gradually to lose its role and the freedom of its decision . this role is now undertaken by syria in all spheres , not just in the foreign , security , defense and political spheres , but also for the most delicate details of internal policy and daily political life .
the lebanese state , for example , can no longer enter into negotiations with israel unless the syrian state gives prior approval . nor can it sign a peace agreement unless syria signs that agreement . nor can the lebanese army deploy on the borders with israel unless agreement is secured from syria . and nor can the role of the lebanese resistance , specifically that of " hizbollah " , end , even if israel were to withdraw from all lebanese territory that it occupies , unless syria agrees to this .
because the close association of the lebanese and syrian tracts has made everything on this matter subject to the coordination of , and understanding between , the two countries .
this close association applies to both the tract and the outcome , to the extent that the president of the lebanese republic is now the work of syria and not lebanon , and the formation of governments in lebanon takes place by syrian intervention in order to subdue the obstacles to which their formation is subject .
if this is the condition of the lebanese state in light of the circumstances that have prevailed for over twenty years , which are odd , why should there be any concern for the view of this state when it has no such view , for the view is that of the syrian state and discussion on any matter lies with it ?
talk about the situation of arab women on international women 's day differs this year , not because there has been some change to the affirmation of their rights and the protection thereof , but because these rights have come to the surface of the talk about reform in the region . it is not only the west that is calling for this ; in fact , many arab regimes are in agreement . it sometimes appears that this is a sudden discovery of half of society .
but , irrespective of whether the talk about the situation of the arab woman and her rights is the result of foreign pressures or otherwise , it does not matter , for the characteristics of change have begun , albeit that they do not in any case mean that the journey will not be very long or very difficult .
the voices of arab women are becoming louder . a salute on the occasion to all the women and men meeting about the issue of women in the beirut summit and the many other conferences in the arab world . another salute to the sultanate of oman , which chose the occasion to appoint , for the first time , a woman to an important ministerial position , that of the ministry of higher education .
this movement and characteristics do not nullify the truth that the most important means for abolishing discrimination against women 's rights is to enact laws that guarantee those rights in all fields , from the home and family to society and work in the private and public domains .
this brings up the problem of female representation in political life in the arab world , which is deficient and not helped by some examples , neither in one party regimes , nor in those that boast a modicum of democracy , such as lebanon .
in this context , a special clause on female representation in the interim iraqi constitution , which was signed yesterday , deserves perusal to consider its merits .
