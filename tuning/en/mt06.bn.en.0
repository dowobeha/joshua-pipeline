welcome to the news bulletin on al-jazeera .
a delegation of hamas leaders headed by khaled mashaal , the head of the movement 's political bureau , held talks with egyptian officials in cairo about developments in the situation in the palestinian territories after the legislative elections and consultations regarding the formation of the future palestinian government .
ismail haniya denied that the egyptian government or the palestinian president had requested the movement to recognize israel as a precondition to being asked to form the next palestinian government .
haniya said that the movement , while committed to its political program and the principles of the palestinian people , was also a realistic and pragmatic movement .
haniya , who is the strongest candidate to head the first hamas government in palestine , added that hamas might accept a long - term ceasefire if israel releases its palestinian prisoners and stops the policy of assassinations .
ah , there are no pressures being applied , ah , by our sister , egypt , on the islamic resistance movement , hamas , regarding hamas 's political stances .
ah , and the relationship between us and , ah , egypt is a relationship based on mutual respect and it consists of many facets . egypt visualized a palestinian - palestinian dialog and we always , i mean , used to agree and understand each other in the shadow of egyptian patronage but there are no pressures applied on the hamas movement by egypt .
of course , the hamas movement has its own political program based on which hamas took part in the election at the same time as being to true to the rights and principles of the palestinian people . at the same time , it is a realistic movement dealing with an open vision , open to the arabic and islamic environment as well as the regional and international . it will take positions and decisions that will preserve the supreme interests of the palestinian people .
in the palestinian territory the attorney general , ahmed al-mughni , said that the investigations regarding corruption have concluded that senior officials in the palestinian authority might have been involved in stealing or squandering public funds of no less than 700,000 dollars .
al-mughni said in a press conference that those involved in these cases will be tried .
the file on the cement used to build the separation wall has been referred to the legislative council .
i will explain about the middle east dossier for pipes which has been referred by the legislative council .
we posit in this file that there are approximately six million dollars , of which four million dollars was the share of the palestinian national authority and two million the share , ah , of the italian authority , the italian government .
this is what was planned on paper but in reality it does not exist .
here , i , we are looking into where this money has been squandered .
there are serious investigations into this matter .
also the dossier on the misuse of identity fraud , deception and forgery of official papers by people in senior positions numbers more the twenty cases . bills of indictment on some of these have been passed to the appropriate court and the rest will be , on completion of the investigation .
we are also investigating a large dossier on the institute of medical jurisprudence in abu dheyf .
the dossier on the society for the protection of citizens shows extremely large financial misappropriation .
it was found that in the dossier on the general council for broadcasting , television and palestinian satellite that there was misappropriation of more than twenty million dollars .
iran announced that it has suspended all its commercial and economic ties with denmark in protest against drawings ( ( published ) ) by one of its newspapers which were offensive to the feelings of muslims .
the european union warned iran that its boycott of danish goods would affect its commercial relations with the union 's states .
today demonstrators stormed the danish embassy compound in tehran and threw fire - bombs before they left in protest against the publication of drawings offensive to the noble prophet .
[ ]
for the second consecutive day iranian demonstrators gave vent to their anger against the danish embassy , storming it and attacking it with fire - bombs in protest against the publication by danish papers of drawings offensive to the messenger , mohammed ibn abdullah , may god 's blessings be upon him .
the attack on the danish embassy is the second of its kind targeted at a western embassy in tehran as yesterday two hundred student demonstrators stormed the austrian embassy smashing its windowpanes and starting small fires . the austrian embassy was targeted because austria is the present chairman of the european union .
denmark protested to iran because of the two attacks on its embassy and demanded that tehran protect its diplomats . meanwhile the european union increased its pressure on arab and islamic states to control such protests and reminded nineteen countries of the treaty that commits them to protecting diplomatic missions .
thousands of other muslims all over the world joined in these protests denouncing the insult to the prophet of islam . some of these were apparently violent as occurred in the afghan capital , kabul , where police struck out with their batons and arrested a number of them when they stoned the danish diplomatic mission .
the kabul protest was preceded by a protest outside bagram , the american military base in afghanistan , where afghan forces fired at protestors , killing four of them and wounding no less than 19 others .
the protest in bagram is considered the first of its kind against an american target .
while protests spread around the islamic world the administration of the american president , george bush , called upon saudi arabia to use its influence to mitigate the tension in the middle east and europe .
denmark asked its citizens in about ten islamic countries to leave because of the background of continuing angry demonstrations at the publication in a danish paper of offensive drawings of the noble messenger .
the crisis between denmark and the islamic world increased and denmark 's ability to contain it weakened despite diplomatic mobilization for this purpose .
[ ]
denmark did not imagine , even in its worst nightmares , that the issue of the cartoons which were offensive to the noble messenger would produce such inflammatory consequences in all senses .
according to reports in the danish media , the scenes of the burning danish embassy and consulate in damascus and beirut shocked and surprised them with the extent of muslim anger all over the world .
the scenes caused the danish foreign minister per stig moller to describe the situation as critical and admit that the crisis had gone beyond denmark .
it is a much bigger crisis than denmark . it threatens the cooperation between the islamic and western worlds
the danish authority thought that an apology from the newspaper jyllands posten which published the drawings together with a reception for the ambassadors of islamic states in copenhagen by the danish prime minister , andres fogh rasmussen , would be enough to calm down popular as well as official sentiment , although it would appear that that was not enough .
while awaiting the diplomatic mobilization which denmark instigated on several fronts to appease the situation , copenhagen has realized that it will be paying a levy in the form of its interests and economics as a result of its silence concerning the violation of the religious sentiments of muslims on its soil .
danish companies could lose 1,600,000,000 dollars if the shelves of shops in islamic countries remain empty of danish goods such as milk and cheese .
the situation does not depend on the economic boycott of danish products because the real surprise was probably caused by the official american and british denunciation of the publication of the pictures .
these denunciations might destroy the great effort that denmark has expended over the years in establishing an outstanding policy of alliance with the united states which have led to it being described in europe as the voice of america .
we continue the
the french magazine charlie hebdo has republished the cartoons which are offensive to the noble prophet , saying that it had done this to support the democratic right to freedom of expression .
the magazine in its editorial condemned what it considered an attempt by religious extremists to force a backing - down from democratic principles .
chirac accused the papers which published the drawings of provocation , and said he thought they inflamed feelings in a dangerous manner .
in indonesia , the foreign minister said that the publication of these drawings which are offensive to the noble prophet was an opportunity exploited by extremist groups to make the situation lose control . this announcement coincided with what the danish prime minister ( ( rasmussen ) ) stressed yesterday , that there were elements pouring oil on the fire for the sake of their own special agenda , hinting directly that there was political and religious use being made of these protests .
[ ]
justification had to be found for all the protests that swept the streets of the islamic world and the extent of the anger which prevented them from listening to the west 's calls for calm .
justification was put forward yesterday by the prime minister of denmark ( ( andres fogh rasmussen ) ) when he said that there were extremists who pour oil on the fire because of what he called their special agendas .
[ speaker 2 ] the indonesian foreign minister today did not greatly disagree with him when he announced that the publication of the cartoons provided an opportunity which was exploited by extremists to make the situation lose control .
[ ]
two statements , based it would seem on pointers noted by observers , some of which are slogans which were adopted here in iran , were aimed at denmark but also the united states , israel and austria which is the present chair of the european union and hosts the headquarters of the international atomic energy agency .
the scene in iran was read as an attempt to exploit religious feelings for the purpose of mobilization against anyone trying to isolate iran because of the background to its nuclear file .
the conspiracy theory itself was used to justify the intensity of the demonstrations in syria and lebanon some of whose politicians accuse damascus of being behind them .
but there was more than one angle to the scenes from the demonstrations . for example it was found that those who were classified by the west in the extremists ' pigeonhole were not always at the forefront of the demonstrators .
in gaza fatah activists rather than those from islamic jihad were the prime movers for the demonstrations .
in beirut the scenes of religious people trying to put a brake on the demonstrators was repeated .
in france as well , the position of the french islamic council appeared to be conservative compared with the position of groups that are classified as secular organizations .
regardless of the follow - up angle and analyses which are presented for each one of these demonstrations , the anger caused to muslim youth as a result of others injuring their deepest religious feelings remains the truth dominating the entire picture .
today in zabol in south afghanistan in a confrontation with the police , at least 4 people were killed and 20 others injured during a demonstration denouncing the cartoons defaming the noble prophet .
in demonstrations which took place last week , an afghani security official stated that the number killed had gone up to ten when police fired in the air to disperse six hundred demonstrators after they threw stones at the police .
the secretary - general of the united nations , kofi annan , the secretary - general of the organization of the islamic conference ekmeleddin oglu and the high representative for foreign policy in the european union , javier solana announced in a press statement , a copy of which al-jazeera has received , their deepest concern for the consequences of publishing drawings defaming the noble prophet and the angry reactions to them .
the statement added that they believed that freedom of press must include a spirit of responsibility , wisdom and respect for all religions and made clear that the latest acts of violence exceeded peaceful protest .
the statement also condemned the attacks on diplomatic missions in damascus and beirut and requested the authorities to protect diplomatic institutions and foreign nationals .
the secretary - general of the united nations , kofi annan , has asked american president george bush for american help to send an international force to darfur . annan stated that the issue of protecting refugees and securing the arrival of aid requires the cooperation of all governments .
american president george bush 's appreciation of what he described as the good leadership of the secretary - general of the united nations and his great optimism for the success of democracy and freedom in the world was met with a request by kofi annan asking america for help in sending an international force to darfur .
i am very happy that we have agreed to work together on the issue of darfur and to work with other governments in europe and asia and other areas to ensure active security on the ground to protect the displaced and secure the arrival of aid to the needy . of course all governments are expected to play their role in this matter .
annan wants a role , supported by president bush , in collecting a force from the international organization in order to stop the violence in the region of darfur in west sudan . the force suggested by annan must have great ability to move in the air and on the ground with good communication equipment from european countries and the united states in order to replace the african union which at present protects civilians in darfur .
despite the announcement by the united nations that the humanitarian situation in the areas that have experienced fighting since 2003 has improved during the last year , hundreds of thousands of people still need help despite the tons of food aid from the world food program as the rate of growth of children in darfur decreased by 4% to 1.4% during 2005 . the number of children who have schools available to them has increased three - fold .
officials with united nations relief organizations believe that 3.5 million , most of whom are displaced , have been helped by more than 14,000 humanitarian workers . they say that the protection of civilians is a huge challenge .
united nations officials are worried by the lack of stability in west darfur on the border with chad as 300,000 people were not able to benefit from humanitarian aid .
the conflict in darfur , after a three - year crisis , resulted in the killing of 300,000 people and the displacement and migration of more than 4 million of the region 's inhabitants and no - one knows if annan 's proposals will solve it this time .
turkey is seeing early discussions taking place with regard to the presidential elections which will be held in april next year .
the opposition considers that the set - up of the existing parliament will enable the justice and development ruling party to name the future president who will , according to the constitution , be elected by parliament .
on the other hand , the government refused the calls of the opposition to carry out early parliamentary elections to precede the election of the president .
the comfortable numerical majority which is enjoyed by the justice and development ruling party in parliament qualifies it to elect a new president after the expiry of the term of president ahmet necdet sezer in the spring of next year .
according to the turkish constitution parliament nominates and elects the president of the republic .
this fact began to worry the opposition which does not want to see an islamist sitting in the presidential palace and turned to demand early elections using the pretext that the set - up of the present parliament does not reflect the views of the people .
the justice and development ruling party gained 34% of votes in the last elections but is represented in parliament by 66% of seats because of the parliamentary threshold law , i.e. it can elect who it wants as president without taking into consideration the view of 65% of the people who did not vote for the justice and development ruling party . this is not just .
the justice and development ruling party refuses to decide on early elections whose results could change the formation of the current parliament and insists on choosing the new president of the country .
we have no intention whatsoever of holding early parliamentary elections before the president of the republic is chosen . the constitution gives us this right and we will not misuse it .
the president of the republic in turkey does not enjoy enormous executive powers but he heads the national security council and appoints senior state bureaucrats in educational , judicial and other institutions and these are powers that the justice and development ruling party needs in order to continue its path of reforms in turkey .
also , the islamic public in turkey will not forgive the justice and development party for missing this opportunity . opinion polls indicate that the party base has among its priorities the election of an islamic president to sit in the presidential palace as a moral victory over secular , ataturkist forces in turkey .
electoral aspirations for an islamic president for turkey means the hopes and dreams of the political islamic trend in turkey are not yet over and that what the justice and development ruling party has acquired in terms of authority and position is only one step on a long road .

five people were killed and dozens wounded in demonstrations targeting western interests in protest against denmark not apologizing for the offensive drawings .
indonesian importers also decided to boycott danish goods in protest against the drawings .
despite the attempts of the european union to calm muslim feelings , some western politicians are escalating the situation by their declarations and attitudes .
in protests against the offensive drawings , pakistani demonstrators drew this picture in the city of peshawar .
dozens were killed and injured after police and special guards intervened .
they did not differentiate between norwegian , american and korean commercial and service offices .
they are protesting against the offensive drawings and demanding an official danish apology .
in pakistan , another protest was meant to be peaceful and artistic .
a donkey competition was held with each donkey carrying a picture of a western leader .
in the philippines where islam was introduced by arab traders , and despite the appearance of their mostly western clothes , extreme protests against the offensive drawings continued intensely .
they tried to be innovative in insulting danish symbols , burning alone being no longer enough and flags were made just to be torn up with great enthusiasm .
we muslims are ready to fight those who mock our messenger , peace be upon him .
fighting .
fighting is not is what is wanted by the european union .
javier solana visited arab countries and from there made general statements about respect for islam .
however , the continued publication and the emergence of new western attitudes caused solana 's mission to fail and some of the european delegates oppose even peaceful methods of protest .
any boycott of danish goods is considered a boycott of european goods .
an italian minister was attributed as having said that he intends to wear shirts with the offensive drawings on them and that he sees this as an invitation to debate .
the debate with the west started in the brushstrokes of an artist on a new iranian website which publishes mocking pictures of the holocaust .
the danish newspaper jyllands posten is not publishing the winning pictures .
as for the danish government , it will be facing a hard test if the newspaper decides later to publish the holocaust pictures because it has said that democratic governments do not interfere in what the press publishes .
sweden , denmark 's neighbor , intervened officially and closed a website which was going to publish the pictures and western politicians objected to the republication .
positions appear to be motivated by fear for interests and lives , proof of which is that they came after peaceful or violent demonstrations and boycotts .
hundreds of additional photos of the torture in abu ghraib prison were shown on a website after those shown on australian television .
however , the american department of defense said that there was no reason to stir up a new commotion about what it described as old photographs .
the scandal coincides with the united nations proposal , which was rejected by the bush administration , to close down another infamous american prison which is guantanamo , something the bush administration has refused to do .
the american administration defended , defends and will defend guantanamo prison despite the harsh criticism .
a legal report by the united nations demanded the prison be shut down immediately .
essentially they looked into questions such as : are they arbitrarily or legally imprisoned ? the conclusion was that they were detained there illegally .
they should be charged and given the opportunity to defend themselves .
i believe that guantanamo should be closed sooner or later .
the official american answer is expected to be no to closing the prison , the detainees are treated humanely and additionally the blame is directed at the united nations team .
the united nations team was given permission to visit guantanamo prison but refused to go there .
the red cross visits detainees with full freedom .
what mack lennon chose not to explain is that the red cross does not publish its reports except to the prison authority which is why the red cross has not revealed any scandal in relation to the treatment of detainees in guantanamo .
as for the united nations team , it refused to visit guantanamo because its members were not given permission to visit the prisoners on their own .
human rights organizations are worried about american attempts to redefine torture , because the american military are the accusers , judges , defending counsels and executioners .
even the european parliament demanded unanimously that international law be applied to guantanamo .
in the name of humanity this prison must be closed and they must be given a fair trial or released if nothing is proved against them .
the united nations report came soon after the publication of the pictures of the torture of iraqi youths in a british military centre in basra , at the same time as new old pictures of torture in abu ghraib
but the american secretary of state does not see the necessity of stirring up another commotion .
these pictures are no worse than those we saw the first time and those who carried out that behavior were punished .
when you torture and beat in that vile way you are no different from dictatorial regimes .
it may be that the greatest embarrassment in the cases of guantanamo and abu ghraib theoretically falls on the arab governments who have given up on their citizens .
the iraqi government actually deplored what went on in abu ghraib and demanded to be given the prison to administer itself .
however its record in jadriya and the news of the death squads will make the choice between an american and a non - american warden difficult for the detainees .
talk about the existence of al-qaida groups in lebanon is linked to the arrest by the lebanese security services of a number of persons who believe in this movement and so set up groups on the ground . investigations have shown that some of them were preparing for military operations .
but the most important issue in this matter is that information is still coming in about a connection between the group arrested in beirut and the crime of assassinating president rafiq al-hariri .
two groups believed to belong to the al-qaida organization here are currently being held by the security services and the lebanese judiciary and investigations are continuing with members of the two groups ( ( ) ) .
the first group consists of five people , four lebanese and one syrian known as abu qatadha . they were arrested in the village of ( ( braya ) ) in the north and information suggests that they were in iraq and imprisoned by the american forces for abut six months and one of them had his legs amputated as a result of a landmine exploding .
the second group was arrested in beirut and consists of 13 people of various arab nationalities who were in possession of arms , forged nationality documents , using false names .
according to security sources , they are :
one : the group 's leader is hassan mohammed nabaa who took part in the ( ( dhinniya ) ) incidents in the year 2000 and fled to syria . he joined his brother in the demonstration on sunday .
two : amer abdullah halaq , a palestinian , mechanical engineer .
three : hani hashim al-shanti , of palestinian origin with lebanese nationality , a computer engineer .
four : hamed turki ( ( al-rubba ) ) , syrian .
five : mohammed abdulrazzaq wafai , syrian .
six : faisal asad , a saudi national who entered lebanon on a forged passport under the name of fahad al-khadim al-yamani , a fighter among the ranks of al-qaida in afghanistan who then went to syria .
seven : mohammed ahmed khoja , syrian .
eight : tarek al-nassir , a syrian neurosurgeon who accompanied some of the groups to iraq .
nine : ali jihad sharafeddin qasir , lebanese , in charge of transporting explosives .
ten : khadhr mohammed nabaa , lebanese .
eleven : malik mohammed nabaa who is responsible for collecting the bags of explosives and explosive devices .
twelve : bara mohammed fuad , syrian .
thirteen : muadh abdulghani shousha , syrian .
information indicates that they all had links with a syrian person from homs known as jamil , an expert in electronic engineering , explosives and booby traps who provided fighters headed for iraq with arms and money . the information also revealed that the two most dangerous members of this group were khalid taha and bilal zaroura who entered lebanon from syria last and who are thought to be in the ain al-hilwa refugee camp . they have never been caught .
interrogation of members of this group is interwoven with information about their involvement in the assassination of president rafiq hariri and the international investigation committee and the american side are asking to see this information which could be examined by a high - level judicial authority .
members of this group are still being held by the information branch of the internal security forces and accompany them to the military investigating judge to continue the investigation into the crime of plotting terrorist acts .
however , the way in which the case is being handled suggest that there is internal information related to the assassination but judicial sources do not confirm this information because they have no material proof at all and say that it is a case of political talk aimed at transferring the charge from one place to another .
good evening .
hizbollah who %pw declined to take part in sunday 's demonstration made use of the scenes of disarray and disorder to present a contradictory picture today of a packed crowd of hundreds of thousands .
in addition to this point concerning the arrangement and organization , hezbollah 's secretary hassan nasrallah made , on the basis of the mar mikhail meeting with general aoun , a political attack on what he called those currently holding power , calling on them to face recent developments and accusing some of those who run the country of taking part in intensifying a political and sectarian atmosphere .
nasrallah who is feeling a new sense of political ease revealed a program of priorities for the coming phase , at the top of which is an invitation to anyone who wishes to wage war on syria or against syria to make use of his party or faction or group but , according to nasrallah , it is not possible to drag the government and state and its institutions into a war of this kind .
on the other hand , hours after hezbollah 's political and popular presentation , prime minister fuad siniora continued to try to pick up the tail ends of last sunday . he held a spiritual summit which he convened during at the government house .
for more details , we are in direct contact with our colleague donis rahmi fakhri .
donis , good evening .
good evening george .
yes . at this time , the summit has n't begun but , i mean , in a few minutes , it will start with the arrival of dignitaries or all the heads of the participating factions in this summit at the governmental palace . it will be presided over by the prime minister %pw sorry , prime minister fuad siniora .
so , ah , among %pw , ah , the heads of the participating factions are the maronite patriarch cardinal mar nasrallah boutrous sfair , the mufti of the lebanese republic sheikh mohammed rasheed qabbani , vice - president of the supreme shiite muslin council sheikh abdulmajid qablan , patriarch gregorius the third the patriarch of antioch and most of al-mashraq , al-iskendaria and orshlaim for roman catholics .
patriarch narcissus pedros 19th , patriarch of the catholic armenians , and doctor salim sihiouni , president of the supreme assembly of the anglican faction in syria and lebanon , are also taking part .
archbishop elias aouda , archbishop boulus matar , archbishop kigham khatsharian as well as archbishop roland abu jawda are also taking part .
as for the druze faction , qadhi nihad hariz , archbishop michel qasarji , archbishop farsai baz , archbishop maratanainos ephram barsoum , sorry , if you , i 'm saying the name wrong , archbishop michel qasarji , archbishop boulus tahdah , monsignor george al-masri , archbishop andre haddad and priest , ah , bishawi , leader of the jerusalem faction in lebanon and syria .
so these are the names of the participants in this spiritual meeting or spiritual summit as george described it .
as we know , there will be , during this summit , an important speech by prime minister fuad siniora whose contents he has refused to disclose before he reads it to the guests .
the meeting is followed , as we also know , by a dinner held by prime minister siniora in honor of all the leaders of the factions taking part today in this meeting at the governmental palace .
george .
the mar maroun al-jummaizi church which was vandalised last sunday today commemorated saint maroun 's day with an official celebratory mass which brought together lebanese dignitaries , headed by presidents emile lahoud and fuad siniora and a representative of leader nabih berri .
mar maroun day was celebrated again this year as lebanon passes through difficult circumstances .
the celebration brought together at mar maroun al-jummaizi church all of lebanon 's spiritual families .
the president of the republic , general emile lahoud , prime minister fuad siniora and a representative of the president of the chamber of deputies , deputy abdul latif al-zane were present .
a large number of ministers , deputies and political , unionist , society , media and spiritual dignitaries , as well as the ambassadors of major foreign countries also took part in the holy celebration .
the celebration was led by archbishop boulis matar who said that the tradition of gathering to pray at the mar maroun church in beirut goes back three - quarters of a century and its continuation is simply a sign that the lebanese , in spite of their differences , are bound together by love .
what is needed today is not name - calling or attacks , which are not constructive , but love .
the loss of security in our capital for a few hours and people 's feelings of being without a roof over their heads to protect their possessions and all that they value sharply brought into focus the question of whether we justified things in the same way 30 years ago when we nearly lost everything , where we shed blood and tears in the hope that we and our future generations would see a bright tomorrow in a safe , stable and fully sovereign country and a competent and just state .
so is it reasonable that any wait is too long for us after all that waiting ?
archbishop matar stressed the need for constant dialogue through consultation with the people and a multiplicity of views in search of the best solutions in the eyes of the majority of citizens .
however , the majority does not bring people together according to their religious or other affiliations but on the basis of their views .
it progresses as power passes successively from one helmsman to another without any discomfiture on anyone 's part .
the free hearts and minds game and free will increase in value as the group becomes increasingly enlightened in its rationality and more used to freedom .
it is undoubtedly the healthiest basis for defining the good of the group because it involves everyone in searching and decision - making .
it also draws upon the majority to decide which majority is to take into consideration the view of the minority and their similarities rather than their differences .
prayers were offered for love to take root in lebanon and for peace to reign throughout its lands .
in kirki , the maronite patriarch , cardinal sfair , emphasized the extent of the need for solidarity in these days of great pressure on lebanon .
today we celebrate saint maroun 's day , the father of our maronite church , and the best way to celebrate saints is to emulate their lives .
a word from the maronite patriarch cardinal mar nasrallah botros sfair .
as he led the celebration at the church on the occasion of saint mar maroun 's day , it was an occasion to mention the life of saint maroun which was characterized by giving , prayer , abstinence and fighting the temptations of the world and its vanities .
cardinal sfair called on the lebanese to stand together in these days of great pressure .
we regret greatly what happened last sunday in the capital beirut in terms of the vandalism and destruction and violations which were intended to ignite the fire of sectarianism and we thank god that people 's awareness allowed them to avoid this evil
we congratulate our maronite brothers and sons on this , our saint 's day , here and in their homes near and far , and we invite them all to emulate the virtues of this saint , especially the qualities of fear of god , his freedom from temptation and his love for the people .
his thoughts say in the lord 's presence we are slaves of no use . amen .
after the celebratory mass , the believers and guests at mar maroun 's day went to the patriarchal palace where cardinal sfair received the french ambassador 's representative francois abu saad , former deputy estafan al-douaie as well as a lebanese forces delegation from ghadir .
the secretary of the maronite cleric 's college in ghadir also spoke .
the situation is extremely difficult and what is intended for this country is now known and that there are those who do want peace for its sons .
but we also have to close ranks and realize that unity is strength and dispersal is weakness .
israel strongly rejected russian president vladimir putin 's invitation to hamas movement leaders to moscow for talks on the middle east peace process .
for its part , washington showed caution with regard to this russian move and reiterated its view that hamas is a terrorist organization while france saw putin 's initiative as possibly strengthening the quartet committee 's role in spite of the initiative being taken without consultation with committee members .
international efforts to contain the hamas movement after its victory in the palestinian legislative elections was breached by russia in a conspicuous move when , from madrid , the russian president vladimir putin promised to invite hamas leaders to moscow for talks on the future of the peace process between the palestinians and israelis .
hamas has never been a terrorist organization in our view .
we have to acknowledge that hamas came to power in the palestinian territories by way of democratic , legal elections .
we have to respect the palestinian people 's decision by finding solutions that all palestinian sides agree on .
according to an official at the russian foreign ministry , moscow is to invite the hamas movement to change its fundamentalist policies to include recognizing israel . the russian proposal was immediately welcomed by hamas .
as we care about relations with , ah , all countries in the international and regional family , this pleases us , the russian visit , and means talks and consultation with the government and russian president .
tel aviv strongly rejected putin 's move and considered it to be effectively a stab in israel 's back .
the israeli education minister meir sheetrit regarded the aim of the initiative as giving international legitimacy to a terrorist group , as he put it .
russia must withdraw from any negotiations on peace in the middle east and i suggest president putin backs down from his decision to invite personalities from terrorist organizations involved in killing .
the israeli position overlaps with washington 's position which showed reserve abut the russian initiative .
they have to recognize israel and renounce terrorism and abide by international agreements signed by the palestinian authority and as russia is a member of the quartet committee , we expect it to pass on the message .
for his part , the american deputy secretary of state for far eastern affairs david welsh pointed out that his country would review its aid to palestinians if the hamas movement forms a new government .
welsh considered that hamas ' agreement to a long - term ceasefire with the hebrew state would not be sufficient .
the head of the executive committee of the lebanese forces , doctor samir geagea , stated that just as the forces fought a war with ugliness so too would they fight for peace with ugliness .
geagea , speaking before ( ( partisans ) ) to the lebanese forces in the aliyah area , announced that work would continue to find a consensual candidate to take over from the late deputy edmond ( ( eid ) ) .
doctor samir geagea confirmed that consultation and the search for a consensual candidate were continuing in order to prevent an election battle in baabda aley .
( ( speech ) ) by the head of the executive committee of the lebanese forces came during the meeting which brought together the forces ' command in the aley area as part of a series of preparatory meetings to restructure the lebanese forces party .
at the present time we are making a very serious attempt to find a candidate to avoid an election battle even though it is a democratic battle , and to find a candidate acceptable to all sides .
( ( reached ) ) is there a candidate who is acceptable to all the sides concerned , and of course we respect all the comrades concerned , especially the free nationalist movement . a consensual candidate means we have to sit in a closed room and discuss all the names put forward and those that have n't been put forward .
put forward and not put forward , so we reach , we 'll contact everyone we represent to find a name that 's acceptable to both sides .
as far as we are concerned , this is how there is consensus , we sit down and put forward one two three fifteen names , ( ( it can get up to ) ) fifteen , until we arrive at a name among them which we are happy with and the rest of the sides involved in the battle are happy with .
this is what we 're testing out at the moment , putting all our weight behind it , concentrating on it fully and we 're trying to achieve it .
i quite simply and honestly wanted to put you in the picture but at the same time , i have to say again that this does n't mean they did n't prepare for the parliamentary elections and make the efforts that led to the required result .
doctor geagea also raised two important issues being discussed in the political arena today , the issue of the economic situation and the need for an effective solution to be implemented . the second issue is the policy of patience and restraint which the lebanese forces are calling for following recent events .
today we fight the battle with courage and just as we fought the war with courage , we want to fight for peace with courage and peace takes a lot more courage than war .
it 's not a phase in the sense of a phase as we know it , when restraint and calmness take much more courage than putting your hand on the trigger and firing .
( ( a place to take over ) ) but not a place for ( ( complete ) ) restraint . how could we leave the economic and social situation and work on politics .
the answer is that there ca n't be any serious economic solutions or any serious social solutions outside of establishing an active , competent state .
you can bring all the experts in the world and they can give you all the solutions you can imagine but they need someone to implement them , who wants to implement them , an active state to implement them , this active state that we do n't yet have .
i 'd like to point out that head of the executive committee of the lebanese forces met with british ambassador james watt for one hour and the british ambassador did n't make any statement .
ah , i apologize , before we continue this news bulletin , for the mistake at the beginning of the report about doctor samir geagea 's position who stated that just as the forces fought a war with courage so too would they fight for peace with courage . the mistake was a typing error .
[ [ ns ] ]
the head of the executive committee of the lebanese forces , doctor samir geagea , spoke on the program naharkum saiid of what he called the rescue plan to liberate the presidency of the republic .
a multifaceted plan because ( ( i do n't see in it ) ) a situation in the country that remains , ah , in the state of fluctuation it 's in now .
of course the presidency is a pivotal position contrary ( ( to what many believe ) ) , so from this departure point , if we hope for any improvement in the situation in the country , we must start from this point .
the fundamentals of this plan are of course still being studied but its basic factors will be constitutional , legal , political and populist .
um .
okay , what is the time span , i mean , is there a defined time span for this story ?
not a lot .
not a lot , of course , ah , any movement on this kind of plan , of this kind , i mean , there 's no - one who can estimate when it will end but we can estimate when it will start .
um .
um .
okay , general michel aoun considered yesterday that extending president lahoud 's term was restrictive just as the election law was restrictive . do you agree with this comparison ?
no , and this , i mean , this comparison is not , is not accurate and not scientific .
extending president lahoud 's term was restrictive in that a group from the intelligence service came and ( ( found the deputies ) ) and threatened them and said to them you have to agree to the extension law , whereas the 2000 election law put forward by the chamber of deputies had a second law in it which was the sixty law after which there was a political settlement .
i repeat it 's not that the intelligence service came and found the deputies and said to them that you must work according to the 2000 law . no , a political settlement came from a ( ( need ) ) on all sides to conduct the elections on time ( ( otherwise the country would be in a constitutional vacuum ) ) .
and on the basis of , ah , berri using his position to pass the 2000 law because ( ( how ) ) a law suited him more , it suited him , the parties had to reach a political settlement and of course a political settlement is one thing , and restrictive extension in terms of %pw , because it is subjugation and coercion is something else altogether .
so the 2000 law , which of course we do n't agree to , came from a political settlement at the time , came from a point of departure based on the situation that was prevalent .
deputy botross harb saw decree 1559 as putting the president of the republic in an illegal situation and was surprised by general michel aoun 's invitation to hold early parliamentary elections .
deputy botross harb said the message he sent ( ( ) ) to the president of the republic general emile lahoud on his birthday was interpreted by president lahud as though it were support for him and when he did n't take the initiative to step down , the march 14 forces had to open the presidential dossier seriously .
ah , of course we would like the president of the republic to be aware of the situation and its danger and the extremely negative repercussions for lebanon if he remains in the situation he is in and which will be very , very damaging to the presidency , apart from the personal damage , i mean , to the president because any discussion we see on television has , to tell the truth , words that are damaging and offensive , and also the position of the president has become absent from , absent , i mean , there is nothing in political life except for statements which come out in response to so and so and this of course damages the presidency , ah , even more , and negative positions on laws that come out of the chamber of deputies , regardless of whether there is a right to reply or not .
harb pointed out many ways of remedying the matter of the presidency and there are the two aspects , constitutional and legal , and there is political and popular work .
( ( sheikh ) ) some of us are aware of the constitution and legal mechanics which you approve of . will you approve what was mentioned in 1559 on the basis of the reports by ( ( larsen ) ) and ( ( milice ) ) , are you going to approve , i mean , removing the president of the republic from power ?
1556 stipulated the need for free presidential elections which comply with the constitution .
what happened on the second day of the elections was that a different decision came out which completely contradicted one of the provisions of this decision and this means that , internationally , the president 's presence contravenes 1556 and contradicts international trends and international legitimacy and this is of course a huge opening in which there could be a way that leads to the president of the republic being in an illegal situation in terms of the international community and in the end , he will be dealt with on this basis . this has n't happened yet and to be honest , we were taking care to make sure it does n't happen because we thought that and so we wanted the president of the republic to take the initiative because the reality he is living is not to be envied , i mean .
( ( sheikh ) ) but general aoun , i mean , who was against an extension and opposed the president of the republic is now opposing the removal of the president from power and calling for presidential elections to be replaced by early parliamentary elections , i mean , what is your response to this ?
the , the goal of the elections , what ?
that we return the
i mean , there may be a result that is different from the current political structure %pw so and so has more and so and so has less , this is not what is needed .
what is needed is for us to make use of this state of international support ( ( for lebanon ) ) and the ensuing national situation which resulted yesterday on february 14 and this , this national marriage happening for the first time in lebanon 's history , for ( ( those born ) ) in lebanon , for those born in a ( ( lebanon ) ) that is free , united , sovereign , independent , i mean , lebanon 's history is seeing something new which it would be a sin to miss ( ( ) ) .
the men have not broken off from the country .
not one of us can claim that he is the only right person and that everyone else is not right .
there are a lot of good people in lebanon and there are people who agree who we can reach an understanding with .
we care about lebanon 's interests , and any person who understands that we have to ensure lebanon 's interest knows we all have to let go of our personal demands and we have to let go of our trends and , to the contrary , make efforts to agree on a person to carry our joint project to build a modern state and establish sovereignty and independence and bring back the state 's power to lebanon , this is the project we have to carry , not that of individuals .
harb considered that in the matter of the presidency , it is not the individual that is important but the project and the individual 's background and aspirations and ability to deal positively with all forces .
