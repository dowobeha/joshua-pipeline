welcome to the news bulletin from aljazeera channel .
a delegation of hamas movement leaders , headed by khaled mishaal , head of the movement 's politburo , is holding talks with egyptian officials in cairo on the most recent developments in the palestinian territories , following legislative elections and consultations regarding the formation of the next palestinian government .
ismail haniya has stressed that neither the egyptian government nor the palestinian president have demanded that the movement recognize israel as a precondition to allow it to form the next palestinian government .
haniya said that although the movement is committed to its political program and the invariables of the palestinian people , it remains realistic and practical .
haniya , one of the strongest potential candidates to lead the first hamas government in palestine , added that hamas might accept a prolonged ceasefire if israel releases palestinian captives and abandons assassination policies .
%pw there are n't any pressures being exerted by %pw our brothers in egypt on the islamic resistance movement , hamas , regarding its political agendas .
%pw our relationship with %pw egypt is based on mutual respect . in various stages , egypt has seen dialogue between palestinian factions and we were , i mean , always agreeing and coming to terms under the guidance of egypt , however egypt is not pressuring hamas .
the hamas movement , of course , has its political agenda , on the basis of which it ran in the elections , and while it will be committed to the rights and invariables of the palestinian people , it will remain a realistic and practical movement which deals openly with our arabic and islamic surroundings , as well as our regional and national surroundings and it will take the stances and decisions that protect the palestinian people 's welfare .
in palestinian territories , attorney - general ahmed al-meghani stated that the investigation into corruption has concluded that prominant leaders in the palestinian authority might be involved in stealing and squandering about seven hundred million dollars from the public purse .
al-meghani stated in a press conference that those involved in these cases will be pursued .
the case of the cement used in building the dividing barrier , relegated by the legislative assembly .
the middle east pipes case , which is referred by the legislative assembly , and i will further clarify the matter of this case .
we have submitted this dossier . there are about 6 million dollars , 4 million of which is the palestinian national authority 's share and 2 million dollars are %pw %pw the italian authority 's , the italian government 's share .
this factory exists on paper only but not in reality .
and here i am investigating where this money has been squandered .
there are serious investigations in this case
as well as the cases of embezzlement , lack of loyalty , loyalty , fraud and forgery of official documents for high - ranking people which exceed twenty cases , some of which i have filed charges against in the relevant courts while the rest are awaiting the conclusion of the investigation .
also the law and medicine institute case in abu - daif , and this is a significant case , which we are investigating as well .
the citizen protection society case , in which there are huge financial embezzlements as well .
the palestinian public radio , television & satellite broadcasting corporation case , in which it has been found that there are embezzlements exceeding 20 million dollars .
iran announced that it has suspended all its trade and economic relations with denmark , in objection to the offensive cartoons , published in one of its newspapers , which offend muslims ' feelings .
the european union has warned iran that its boycott of danish products will affect its trade relations with eu countries .
furthermore , demonstrators broke again into the danish embassy grounds in tehran and hurled molotov cocktails before they left in a protest against publishing cartoons that are offensive to the noble prophet .
[ ]
for the second consecutive day , iranian protestors have unleashed their wrath upon the danish embassy , into which they broke , attacking it with molotov cocktails as a protest against the publication in danish newspapers of cartoons that are offensive to the prophet mohammed bin abdullah , peace and blessings be upon him .
the attack on the danish embassy is considered the second of its kind to be aimed at a western embassy in tehran , after nearly 200 student demonstrators hurled rocks at the austrian embassy yesterday , breaking its glass and igniting small fires in it . the austrian mission was targeted , since austria is the current leader of the european union .
denmark has complained to iran , because of the two attacks against its embassy and demanded tehran protect its diplomats , while the european union escalated its pressure on arab and islamic countries to control these kinds of protests , reminding nineteen countries with treaties that oblige them to protect diplomatic missions .
thousands of muslims worldwide joined in the demonstrations denouncing the humiliations against the prophet of islam , some of which were characterized by acts of violence as was the case in the afghani capital , kabul , where members of the police force assailed demonstrators with cudgels , for throwing rocks at the danish diplomatic mission , and arrested a number of them .
the demonstration in kabul was preceded on monday by a demonstration outside bagram , the us military base in afghanistan , where afghani forces fired at demonstrators , killing 4 of them and injuring no less than 19 others .
the bagram demonstration is considered the first of its kind against a us target .
as protests began to spread throughout different areas of the islamic world , the administration of us president george bush appealed to the kingdom of saudi arabia to use its influence to help reduce tensions in the middle east and europe .
denmark called for its subjects in around ten islamic countries to leave the countries against the backdrop of continuing angry demonstrations , caused by a danish newspaper 's publishing of cartoons offensive to the noble prophet .
the crisis between denmark and the islamic world escalated , crippling denmark 's ability to contain it , in spite of their diplomatic alertness for that purpose .
[ ]
denmark never imagined , even in its worst nightmares , that the cartoons humiliating the noble prophet would result in such ignited consequences , in every sense of the word .
denmark was shocked by scenes of the danish embassy and consulate in damascus and beirut being burned , as reported in the danish media , and was astounded by the extremity of islamic anger throughout the world .
scenes that led the minister of foreign affairs in denmark , per stig moeller to describe the situation as critical and admit that the crisis went beyond denmark .
it is a problem far larger than denmark , as it threatens cooperation between the islamic and western worlds .
the danish government thought the apology of jyllands - posten , the newspaper that published the cartoons , as well as the danish prime minister , anders fogh rasmussen 's reception of islamic ambassadors in copenhagen , was enough to calm down public and official opinion too , but that was obviously insufficient .
as it waited for the intensive diplomatic campaign , started by denmark on more than one level , to calm the situation , copenhagen realized that its interests and economy would shoulder the costs of its silence over offending muslims ' religious feelings , on its land .
one billion and six hundred million dollars is the possible loss that may be incurred by danish companies , if store shelves in islamic countries remain void of danish milk and cheese , for example .
however , it does n't end with the economic boycott of danish products , since the real shock came from the official american and british denunciations of the publication of the cartoons .
condemnations that might undermine the immense efforts exerted by denmark throughout the years in pursuit of the establishment of a unique coalition with the united states , to the extent that it has been described by europe as the mouthpiece of the united states .
we continue %pw
the french magazine , charlie hebdo , republished the cartoons that are offensive to the noble prophet , saying it did so in order to support the democratic right to free speech .
the magazine condemned in its editorial what it considered an attempt by extremists to seize concessions on matters related to democratic principles .
furthermore , french president jacques chirac accused the newspapers that published these cartoons of being provocative , claiming their action will stir up feelings with dangerous ramifications .
in indonesia , the minister of foreign affairs declared that publishing the cartoons offending the noble prophet was a chance seized by extremist groups to send the situation out of control . this declaration is similar to that of the danish prime minister , rasmussen , who stressed yesterday that there are members who add fuel to the fire for their own private agenda , directly hinting at the existence of political and religious exploitation of these protest campaigns .
[ [ ns ] ]
it was necessary to find justification for all these protests sweeping streets in the islamic world , and for the extremity of the rage that prevented people from heeding western appeals to pacify the conflict .
justification offered by danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen yesterday , when he spoke of the existence of extremists who add the fuel to the fire for the sake of what he called their own private agendas .
the indonesian minister of foreign affairs did not disagree with him too much today when stating that publishing the cartoons that offend the noble prophet has created a chance that was seized by extremists to send the situation out of control .
[ [ ns ] ]
two announcements apparently based on indicators identified by observers , some of which are the slogans lifted here in iran which targeted denmark as well as the united states , israel and austria , which leads the european union and houses the international atomic energy agency 's headquarters .
the scene in iran was viewed as an attempt to exploit religious feelings to charge people against whoever tries to isolate iran on the backdrop of its nuclear portfolio .
the same conspiracy theory was used to justify the intensity of demonstrations in syria and lebanon , some of the politicians of which hastened to accuse damascus of supporting the demonstrations .
however , these demonstrations can be viewed from different perspectives . for it has been revealed that some of the people considered to be extremists by the west were n't always at the forefront of demonstrators .
in gaza , fateh and islamic jihad activists , respectively , formed the main driving force behind the demonstrations .
and in beirut , the scene of clergymen trying to curb demonstrators was repeated .
in france too , the attitude of the french islamic council appeared to be reserved in comparison to the attitude of organizations classified as secular organizations .
regardless of the angle from which you follow these demonstrations and interpretations put forward by each one of them , the anger of each muslim youth , due to the offensive made by others on his most profound religious feelings , will remain the truth enveloping the entire picture .
in afghanistan , at least four people were killed today and twenty others were injured during a demonstration denouncing the cartoons offending the noble prophet , in the zabul province south of afghanistan , during confrontations with the police .
an afghani security official mentioned today that police fired shots in the air to disperse 600 demonstrators , who cast stones at the police , which raises the number of deaths in demonstrations in afghanistan during the last week to 10.
un secretary - general kofi annan , secretary - general of the organization of islamic conference , akmal al-din oglo , and the european union high representative for foreign policy , javier solana , all expressed in a press statement , a copy of which al-jazeera had received , their deep concern regarding the consequences of publishing the cartoons that offend the noble prophet , and the enraged reactions to the affair .
the statement went on , " we think that freedom of the press requires responsibility and rationality and the necessity to respect all religions " , describing the latest acts of violence as overstepping the limits of peaceful demonstrations .
the statement also condemned the attacks on diplomatic missions in damascus and beirut and called on the authorities to protect diplomatic facilities and foreign citizens .
kofi annan , secretary - general of the united nations , has requested from us president , george bush , american help in sending an international force to darfour . annan said that the matter of protecting emigrants and securing access to aid requires the cooperation of all governments .
us president george bush 's praise of what he described as the good leadership of the un secretary - general and his great optimism for the success of democracy and freedom in the world was met by kofi annan 's request for american assistance in sending an international force to darfour .
i 'm glad we have agreed to work together on the darfour affair and to work with other governments in europe and asia and other areas to ensure an effective security presence on the ground to protect the homeless and ensure access to aid for the needy . this , of course , is a matter in which all governments should play a role .
a role that annan wants to be supported by president bush in order to collect an international organization force to stop violent acts in the darfour region , in the west of sudan . the suggested force , however , should have a high capacity to move on ground and in the air with efficient communication equipment to replace the african union forces that protect civilians in darfour at the moment .
in spite of the united nation 's declaration that the humanitarian status improved last year in the areas that are witnessing such a struggle since the year 2003 , hundreds of thousands of people are still lacking aid despite the tons of aid from the world food program . furthermore , the average development among children in darfour has descended from about 4 percent to 1.4 percent during year 2005 and the number of children who have been provided by schools has increased threefold .
the leaders of relief operations in the united nations say that 3.5 million emigrants were assisted by more than 14,000 humanitarian relief workers . they add that protecting civilians is very challenging .
leaders in the united nations are concerned about the unstable situation in west darfour at the border of chad , where over 300,000 people were not able to receive humanitarian aid .
after three years of the crisis , the conflict in darfour has caused the death of about 300,000 people and the exodus and asylum seeking of more than 2 million inhabitants of the region , and no one knows if annan 's proposals would resolve it for sure .
turkey %pw has started an early debate on the presidential elections which will be held in april next year .
the opposition believes the makeup of the current parliament allows the ruling justice and development party to single - handedly name the next president who will be elected by the parliament according to the constitution .
on the other hand , the government rejects the opposition 's calls for running early parliamentary elections prior to the selection of a president for the republic .
the comfortable majority , which the ruling justice and development party enjoys in parliament qualifies it to choose a new president for the republic after the end of president ahmet necdet sezer 's term next spring .
and according to the turkish constitution , the parliament nominates and elects the republic 's president .
%pw truth is a cause of concern for the opposition , which does n't want to see an islamist seated in the republican palace , and moved to call for early elections , on the pretext that the current parliamentary makeup does n't represent public opinion .
the ruling justice and development party got 34% of votes during the last elections , but it 's represented in parliament by a proportion of 66% of seats , due to the parliamentary threshold law . in other words , it can elect whomever it likes as president , with a complete disregard to the opinion of 65% of the populace , who did n't vote for the justice and development party . this is unfair .
the ruling justice and development party refuses to resort to early elections , which might change the results of the current parliamentary makeup , insisting that it will be the one to choose the new president of the republic .
we have no intentions whatsoever of holding early parliamentary elections before the selection of a president for the republic . the constitution grants us this right , and we will not give it up .
the republic 's president in turkey enjoys no great executive powers , but he heads the national security council and appoints the beurocratic leaders in the nation , in educational institutions and judicial bodies among others . these powers are necessary for the justice and development party to continue its reform quest in turkey .
moreover , the islamic public in turkey will not forgive the justice and development party for forgoing this opportunity , since public opinion polls indicate that the party base includes in its priorities the election of an islamic president from amongst themselves , to be seated in the presidential palace as a psychological triumph over the secular attaturk powers in turkey .
the aspirations to elect an islamic president for turkey means that the wishes and dreams of the islamic political trend in turkey have not yet ended , and that whatever influence and positions the justice and development party has attained are but a mere step on a tortuous path .

five people have been killed and dozens injured in demonstrations targeting western interests , in a protest against denmark 's refusal to apologize for its slanderous cartoons .
in addition , indonesian importers have decided to boycott danish products , in protest against those cartoons .
despite attempts by the european union to calm muslims , some western politicians are escalating the situation with their statements and opinions .
in protest against the defaming cartoons , pakistani protestors drew this picture of the city of bishago .
dozens were killed and injured following the intervention of police and special forces .
they did not differentiate between norwegian , american or korean trade and service offices .
they are protesting against the offensive cartoons and demanding an official danish apology .
and in pakistan , another demonstration was organized to be a peaceful and artistic one .
a mule contest in which each mule carries the picture of a western leader .
in the philippines where islam succeeded thanks to arab merchants , protests continued and despite their apparent western outfits , for the most part their protests were strong against the offensive cartoons .
they attempted to be innovative in insulting the symbols of denmark . burning alone no longer sufficed and they made flags in order to rip them up later with great enthusiasm .
we muslims are ready to fight against whoever mocks our prophet , peace and blessings be upon him .
fighting
fighting is what the european union does not want .
javier solana visited several western countries from which he make public statements stressing the respect for islam .
however , the repeated republication and publicizing new western opinions thwart solana 's mission to fail , and some european representatives are even protesting against peaceful means of protest .
any boycott of danish products is considered a boycott of the products of the european union .
an italian minister was quoted as saying that he intends to wear shirts bearing the defaming cartoons , considering this in itself to be a invitation to dialogue .
the dialogue , painted by an artist 's brush , with the west , started on a new iranian website publishing sarcastic cartoon of the holocaust .
danish newspaper jyllands - posten did not publish the winning cartoons .
as for the government of denmark , it will face a difficult test if the newspaper later decides to publish the holocaust cartoons , because the danish government said that democratic governments never interfere with what newspapers publish .
however , sweden , denmark 's neighbor , intervened officially and shut down a website that published the cartoons , and western politicians objected to republication .
these opinions are apparently motivated by fear for interests and lives , since they 've come in response to peaceful or violent protests and boycotting campaigns .
a website has published hundreds of additional photos of the torture taking place in abu ghraib prison , following the pictures shown on australian television .
however , the us department of defense stated that there is no need to cause a commotion in regards to what it described as old pictures .
the scandal coincides with the united nations ' proposal to shut down another notorious american detainment camp , guantanamo bay , which was rejected by president bush .
the american administration defended , is defending and will defend the guantanamo bay detention camp , despite scathing attacks .
a un judicial report has called for the immediate closure of the detainment camp .
they mainly addressed questions like whether they are random detainees or legal detainees , and the conclusion was that they were detained there in an illegal manner .
charges must be laid against them , and they must be given the opportunity to defend themselves .
and i believe it will be necessary to close guantanamo bay sooner or later .
the official american response expected is rejection of closing the camp , a claim that the detainees are treated humanely , and to top it all off , blame directed at the united nations team .
the united nations team was granted permits to visit the guantanamo bay detention center , but its members refused to go there .
and the red cross visits the detainees freely .
what mac lenin chose not to clarify was that the red cross does n't publish its reports except to the detaining authority , for which reason the red cross did n't uncover any scandals relating to the treatment of detainees at guantanamo bay .
as for the un team , they refused to visit guantanamo bay , because its members would not be permitted to meet privately with detainees .
the human rights organizations are concerned about american attempts to redefine torture and because the american soldiers are the attorneys - general and the judges and perhaps the flagellators later on .
even the european parliament unanimously demanded that detainees be treated according to international law
in the name of humanity , this detention camp must be closed and they must be given fair trials or released if nothing is proven against them .
the united nations report came following the publication of pictures depicting the torture of iraqi youths in a british military camp in basra , which coincided with the publication of new " old " pictures of the torture in abu ghraib .
but the us secretary of defense sees no need to create a commotion .
these pictures are no more than those we saw the first time , and those who committed those acts were punished .
when you torture or beat so brutally , you are no different to dictatorial regimes .
the greater embarrassment in the guantanamo bay and abu ghraib cases falls theoretically on arab regimes for abandoning their citizens .
the iraqi government actually condemned what took place in abu ghraib and demanded the transfer of the prison to its control .
but its record in al-jadereya and news of the death squads will render the choice between an american imprisoner and a non - american one difficult for detainees .
talk of the presence of al-qaeda linked groups in lebanon was sparked by the recent arrest made by the lebanese security services of several people who believe in this ideology , who formed groups on the ground . investigations revealed that some of them were preparing for military operations .
but what is more important in the case is the information which is still being circulated regarding the connection between a group arrested in beirut and the assassination of the martyred prime minister rafiq hariri .
two salafi groups believed to be affiliated with the al-qaeda organization are in the grip of security services and the lebanese judicial system , and investigations of the members of those two %pw groups continue .
the first group comprises five members , four lebanese and one syrian known as abu qutada , who have been arrested in the village of ber'aya to the north . information indicates that they were in iraq and were imprisoned by the american forces for six months , and one of them lost his legs in a land mine explosion .
the second group was arrested in beirut , and comprises 13 members of various arab nationalities , who had in their possession weapons and fake citizenship documents and called each other by aliases .
and according to security sources , they are :
one , the emir of the group , hassan mohammed nabaa , who had participated in the events of al-denya in the year 2000 , and fled to syria . he joined his brother in sunday 's demonstrations .
two , amer abdullah , a palestinian barber , a mechanical engineer .
three , hani hashem al-shanti , who is of palestinian origin , bearer of the lebanese nationality , and a computer engineer .
four , hamad turki al-rabaa , a syrian .
five , mohammed abdel razzaq wafa'i , a syrian .
six , faisal asaad akbar , a saudi national . he entered lebanon on a fake passport by the name of fahed mohammed al-khadem al-yamani , who fought on the side of al-qaeda in afghanistan , then later moved to syria .
seven , mohammed ahmed kouja , a syrian .
eight , tareq al-naser , a syrian neurosurgeon , who accompanied some of these members to iraq .
nine , ali jihad sharaf al-deen qaser , a lebanese whose mission is to transport explosives .
ten , kheder mohammed nabaa , a lebanese .
eleven , malek mohammed nabaa , who was in charge of collecting bags of explosives and explosive devices .
twelve , baraa ' mohammed fouad , a syrian .
thirteen , muath abdel ghani shousha , a syrian .
the information indicates that all of these are connected to a syrian man from homs , known as jamil , an expert in electronic engineering , explosives and booby - trapping . he used to provide fighters heading to iraq with weapons and money and the information also revealed that the two most dangerous members of this group , khaled taha and belal zaaroura , entered lebanon from syria last december , are thought to be in the ain al-helwa refugee camp , and they were never arrested .
interrogations of the members of this group are the subject of much speculation regarding its involvement in the assassination of prime minister rafiq hariri . the international investigation team and the american side demanded to see this information , which might have been examined by a high ranking judicial authority .
members of this group are still in the grip of the information branch of the internal security forces , who are escorting them to the military interrogations judge to resume interrogations with them in regards to the criminal attempt to carry out terrorist acts .
nonetheless , the method of handling this case implies that there is inside information related to the assassination , but judicial sources do not confirm this information , because they have no circumstantial evidence and they say it 's all a matter of political talk , aimed at shifting accusations .
good evening .
hizbullah , which %pw refrained from participating in sunday 's demonstration , benefited from the scene of anarchy and discord to present today a contradictory picture , through an organized and lined crowd of hundreds of thousands .
and in addition to this point of order and organization , the leader of hizbullah , hassan nasrallah , is relying on pushing for the meeting between mar mikhail and colonel awn in a political attack on those he called " the ones clinging to power currently " , calling on them to accept the truth brought about by the latest developments , accusing some of those running the country of fomenting tension in the political and sectarian arena .
nasrallah , who senses a new - found political comfort made public a priority plan for the coming period , most importantly calling on anyone wishing to wage war with or on syria to make use of his party or sect or group , but it is not permissible , according to nasrallah , to drag the government or the state and its institution into a war of this kind .
on the other hand , hours after the political and popular show by hizbullah , prime minister fouad al-sanioura sought to continue containing the ramifications of last sunday , by gathering a spiritual summit to be held in the meantime in the grand place .
for more details , we head to live coverage from there by our colleague donis rahmi fakhri .
donis , good evening .
good evening , george .
yes , the summit has not yet commenced , but in a few moments it will start , as we are awaiting the arrival of all the heads of the sects participating in this summit in the grand palace , under the auspices of the head of government %pw pardon me the head of government fouad al-sanioura .
if %pw from %pw the members of participating sects , the maronite patriarch , cardinal mar nasrallah , botros sufeir , mufti of the republic of lebanon , sheik mohammed rasheed qabbani , deputy president of the supreme islamic shiite council , sheik abdel majid qabalan , patriarch gregorios the third laham , the roman catholic patriarch of antioch and the entire east and alexandria and jerusalem .
also participating are patriarch narsis pedros the nineteenth , patriarch of the armenian catholics , and dr. selim sehiouna , head of the supreme council of the anglican church in syria and lebanon .

and as we 've learned , during this summit there will be an important address by the head of %pw government fouad al-sanioura , the content of which he refused to reveal before reading it in front of the audience .
following the meeting also , as we learned , will be a dinner banquet , held by the head of government al-sanioura , in honor of all heads of sects participating today in this meeting in the grand palace .
george
the church of mar maron al-jemmeizi , which was exposed to riotous acts last sunday , held today the memorial feast of saint maron with an official celebration mass gathering various lebanese groups , at the forefront of whom are both the head of state emil lahhoud and head of government fouad al-sanioura , as well as a representative of head of parliament berri .
the celebration of mar maron 's feast comes around this year as lebanon goes through a tough time .
the feast , held in mar maron al-jemmeiza church , attracted all spiritual families in lebanon .
the president of the republic colonel emil lahhoud attended , along with the head of government fouad al-sanioura , and representing the head of the house of representatives was deputy abdel latif al-zein .
also participating in the holy offering was a large number of ministers and representatives , as well as political , syndicate , social , media and spiritual figures , and ambassadors of major foreign states .
heading the offering was metropolitan paulos matar , who affirmed that it was a social tradition to pray at the mar maron church in beirut , which dated back three quarters of a century , and the continuance of which was a sign that the lebanese people , despite their differences , are attracted to each other through love .
what is required today is not mistrust or assault , which are n't constructive , but rather love .
the security we lost in our capital in a space of hours , and people 's feeling that they had no roof to shelter their necks , their livelihoods and their sanctified entities , have sharply called into question the hopes we have been entertaining for thirty years , during which we almost lost everything , and shed much blood and tears , in the hope that we and our generations would have a bright future in a secure and stable homeland , independently sovereign , an able and just nation .
is it , then , reasonable to wait so long ?
metropolitan matar emphasized the necessity of continual dialogue , with consultation between people and via a multitude of opinions seeking the best solution , as seen by the majority of citizens
that the majority does not unite people on the basis of their religious affiliations or otherwise , but on the basis of their opinions .
and it is transferred along with the shift of power from one party to another and without any embarrassment whatsoever .
the game of free minds , hearts and wills increases in value the more the group is enlightened in its rationalism and experienced in its liberty .
and undoubtedly , it is the safest basis for determining the welfare of the group , because it involves everyone in discussion and decision - making .
it is also incumbent on the majority , any majority , to take into account the opinion of the minority and the elements of common grounds between them before the elements of difference .
prayers were held on this occasion for the consolidation of love in lebanon and peace in all its quarters .
and in kirki , the maronite patriarch , cardinal sufeir , emphasized in the feast sermon the extent of the need for solidarity in these dark days lebanon going through .
today we celebrate the feast of saint maron , the father of our maronite church and the best way to celebrate saints is to be guided by their life stories .
an address by the maronite patriarch , cardinal mar nasrallah botros sufeir .
during his heading the celebratory mass in the patriarchal edifice , on the occasion of celebrating the feast of mar maron , there was opportunity to remind all of the life of saint maron , which was characterized by generosity , prayer and asceticism , as well as struggling against the temptations of the world and its vanities .
cardinal sfeir called on the lebanese people to unify in these tough times .
for we are extremely sorrowful at what happened last sunday in the capital beirut , the destruction and demolition and violations intended to ignite the flame of strife . we thank the lord that the citizens ' awareness allowed them to evade this evil .
we congratulate our brethren and children , the maronites , on this feast here and in their lands of estrangement , near and far , and we call on all of them to emulate the virtues of this saint , especially his fear of god , his divesting himself of the world 's vanities , and his love of others .
and his very own tongue says in the presence of the almighty : we are useless servants . amen .
following the celebratory mass , worshippers and greeters of the feast of maron went to the patriarchal edifice , where cardinal sfeir received the envoy of the french ambassador francois abi saad , and the former deputy estefan al-duwei'i , in addition to a delegation from the lebanese forces from ghadeer .
also giving a speech was the spokesman for a delegation of maronite clerical graduates in ghadeer .
circumstances are very harsh and what 's being plotted against this nation has become clear , namely that there are people who desire no rest for its citizens .
however , we must unify our ranks and cling to each other , knowing full well that in unity lies power and in division weakness .
israel has strongly rejected russian president vladimir putin 's invitation to the leaders of the hamas movement to visit moscow to discuss the peace process in the middle east .
on the other hand , washington viewed the russian initiative , renewing its categorization of hamas as a terrorist organization , while france viewed putin 's initiative could complement the efforts of the quartet , despite this initiative %pw being made without consultation with members of the quartet .
international endeavors to corner hamas , following its victory in the palestinian legislative elections , have been thwarted by russia , in a noticeable position . from madrid , russian president vladimir putin promised to invite hamas leaders to moscow soon , to discuss the future of the peace process between palestinians and israelis .
hamas has never been a terrorist organization in our opinion .
we must recognize that hamas has reached power in the palestinian territories as a result of legitimate democratic elections .
we must respect the choice of the palestinian people by finding solutions acceptable to all palestinian parties .
insofar as an official of the russian foreign ministry mentioned that moscow would invite the hamas movement to occasion a change in its radical policies to include a recognition of israel , the russian suggestion received an immediate welcome from hamas .
keen on relations with %pw all countries %pw both international and regional , as we are pleased to visit russia and you know hold talks and consultations with the government and the %pw russian president .
tel aviv strongly denounced putin 's initiative , considering it an actual stab in israel 's back .
israeli minister of education meir shitreet opined that the aim of the initiative was to grant international legitimacy to a terrorist organization , in his words .
russia must withdraw from any peace negotiations in the middle east and i suggest to president putin that he recant his decision to invite members of a terrorist organization involved in murder .
the israeli stance matched that of washington which expressed its reservations regarding the russian initiative .
they must recognize israel , shun terrorism , and adhere to international treaties signed by the palestinian authority , and since russia 's a member of the quartet , we expect it to convey the same message .
on his part , assistant us secretary of state for near east affairs , david welch , pointed out that his country will reconsider its aid to palestine in the case of hamas forming the new government .
welch stressed hamas ' acceptance of a long - term ceasefire with the jewish state will not be sufficient .
head of the executive committee in the lebanese forces party , dr. samir geagea , affirmed that the forces will enforce peace as barbarically as they waged war .
%pw geagea , before the supporters of the lebanese forces party in the area of baabda - aley , announced the continuance of work towards finding an agreeable candidate to succeed the late deputy edmund eid .
dr. samir geagea stressed there are ongoing consultations in search of an agreeable candidate to avoid a tight election battle in baabda - aley .
an address by the head of the executive committee of the lebanese forces party came during the meeting which gathered the cadres of the forces in the area of baabda - aley , within the framework of regular preparatory meetings to restructure the lebanese forces party .
we are currently making great efforts to find a candidate so we avoid an election battle , although it would be a democratic battle , and reaching an agreement on a candidate who will please all parties .
you have now reached an agreement on a candidate to please all parties concerned , and of course we respect all parties concerned , especially the free patriotic movement . an agreeable candidate entails that we sit in a closed room and discuss all the names suggested and those not suggested .
those suggested and those not suggested , so that we can both , with all we represent , reach a name accepted by both sides .
as for us , this is the way to achieve accord , we sit and suggest a name , two names , three , five , ten , perhaps even fifteen or twenty , or whatever , till we reach a name amongst them that would please us and the other parties involved with the battle .
that 's what we 're attempting at the moment , we 've finally mobilized all our energy and focused on it , and we 're trying to get there .
i wanted , in all honesty and simplicity , for you to be in the picture , but at the same time i tell you , this does n't mean not to prepare for parliamentary elections , for perhaps this attempt will not yield the required result .
dr. geagea also tackled two pivotal topics being discussed in political circles today , namely , the economic situation and the necessity of finding an actual solution that can be implemented , and the other topic is the policy of restraint and self - control , for which the lebanese forces party is calling , in light of the latest incidents .
today we have waged the war valiantly , and inasmuch as we waged the war valiantly , we wish to embark on peace with valiance . peace takes far greater courage than war .
manhood is not always the manhood we know . at times , self - control and self - restraint require far greater courage than placing one 's hand on the trigger and firing .
anyone can aim and fire , but not anyone can control himself not to fire . some take it against us that we have neglected economic and social conditions while focusing on politics .
the answer is that we cannot consider any serious economic or social solutions in isolation from the need to establish a true capable state .
any solution you come up with , you can bring all the world 's experts and they 'll present you with all the solutions imaginable , but these solutions require someone to implement them . who will implement them ? they require a true capable state to implement them , which we have n't yet got .
it is worth mentioning the head of the executive committee of the lebanese forces party had met , at his headquarters in al-arz , with british ambassador james watt for an hour , and the ambassador made no statements .
%pw i apologize %pw before we resume the news for the error made at the start of the report in regards to the stance of dr. samir geagea , who assured us that inasmuch as the forces waged %pw the war valiantly , they will embark on peace valiantly . moreover , that mistake was due to a typo .

the chairman of the executive committee in the lebanese forces party , dr. samir geagea , spoke on the good day program about what he called a plan to salvage the presidency 's credibility .
a versatile plan because i do n't think the situation of the country can remain in its current inflexible state .
contrary to what many think , the position of the republic 's presidency is a central one . hence , if we hope for improvement of the situation in the country , we have to start from this particular position .
the components of this plan are still being studied , of course , but its primary components will be constitutional , legislative , political and public .
um .
alright , and what is its duration , i mean is there a specific duration for this issue ?
not much .
not much , of course . %pw this kind of movement , this kind of strategy , i mean , no one can estimate when exactly it will end but we can estimate when it will commence .
um .
um .
okay , colonel michel awn considered yesterday that the extension for president lahhoud was compulsory as was the election legislation . do you support this comparison ?
no , and %pw , honestly , this comparison is %pw not accurate and not empirical .
the extension for president lahhoud was compulsory in the sense that the intelligence services hassled the parliamentary representatives and told them you have to sign the extension legislation while the 2000 election legislation was submitted it to parliament . there was another submitted legislation , which is the legislation of 1960 . a political settlement took place after negotiations .
i repeat , it 's not that the intelligence services seized the representatives and told them you have to go and sign the 2000 legislation . no , a political settlement took place stemming from the need for elections at that time . well , the country will lose with a constitutional void .
%pw due to the %pw exploitation by head of parliament berri of his position to pass the 2000 legislation because of how it suits him , the legislation that suits him best , the parties had to establish a political settlement . political settlement is , of course , one thing and compulsory extension another %pw because oppression and compelling are totally different things .
thus , the 2000 legislation of which we do not approve , of course , has been passed through a political settlement that took place at that time due to the prevalent circumstances .
parliamentary representative botros harb considered that resolution 1559 puts president lahhoud in an illegal position and was astonished by colonel michel awn 's call for early parliamentary elections .
parliamentary representative botros harb says that the message he addressed to the republic 's president , colonel emil lahhoud on christmas was interpreted by president lahhoud as a message of support and when he did not take the initiative to decide to step down , it became necessary for the march 14 forces to lay open the presidency dossier seriously .
yes of course , we hope that the president realizes how dangerous this situation is and its extremely negative consequences on lebanon if it remains in this situation , for it is inflicting great harm on the presidency regardless of the harm affecting him personally . for the president , in any symposium any symposium we watch on tv is being addressed by harmful and insulting speech . furthermore , the presidency 's position has become absent %pw absent . i mean it does not exist in political life except in statements in response to this and that , which harms the presidency more %pw . in addition to negative attitudes in replying to legislations established by the house of representatives regardless of whether he has the right to respond .
harb pointed out different ways of dealing with the problem of the presidency . there are constitutional and legislative aspects as well as political and public work .
sheikh , can we know what is the constitutional and legislative strategy adopted by you ? will you adopt what has been mentioned in resolution 1559 , in the larsen and melis reports ? what will you adopt to remove the president of the republic ?
the 1559 resolution stipulated the necessity of holding free presidential elections that respect the provisions of the constitution .
what happened in the elections the second day the resolution was issued is totally against one of the clauses of this resolution . this means that he is a president whose presence is internationally violates the 1565 resolution and he opposes the international trend lobbyist and the international legitimacy . this , of course , is a significant loophole that might be handled politically in a manner that might place the president in an illegal status regarding the international community and thus he 'd be treated accordingly . this has n't occurred so far and the truth is we were keen it would n't because we suspected that we might get to this endeavor . consequently we desired that the president himself take the initiative because he is in a very critical situation .
sheikh , but %pw colonel awn , who was against the extension and was opposed to the president of the republic is reluctant now to remove the president and calls instead for a presidential election , for an early parliamentary election . what 's your answer to this quote ?
what 's the %pw purpose of the elections ?
it 's to %pw %pw
the result might come out different to the current political structure so that this would have more and that would have less . that 's not the aim .
the aim is to make use of the international support status , lebanon , and from the current national situation , which was apparent yesterday , the 14th of march %pw . this national bond occurs for the first time in the history of lebanon , for the rebirth in lebanon , first the rebirth of the one and only free sovereign independent lebanon . the history of lebanon is witnessing a new thing that it would be a great loss to miss .
men are not absent from the country .
none of us can claim to be the only virtuous person , while all the rest are wicked .
there are plenty of good people in lebanon and there are people we agree to reconcile with .
we are primarily concerned about the welfare of lebanon . if we agree that any person amongst us is capable of guaranteeing the welfare of lebanon , we all have to spare our personal needs and give up our directions . on the contrary , let us exert an effort to come to an agreement on a person who believes in our common plan for building a modern country and laying the foundation of sovereignty and independence and to again spread the government 's authority all over lebanon . this is the plan we should achieve not individuals ' projects .
harb perceives that what is important in the presidency problem is not the individual , but the project and the history of the person , his ambition and ability to positively deal with all forces .
